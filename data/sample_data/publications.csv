10.1111/ecoj.12210,Poverty and Aspirations Failure,,"We develop a theoretical framework to study the psychology of poverty and 'aspirations failure', defined as the failure to aspire to one's own potential. In our framework, rich and the poor persons share the same preferences and same behavioural bias in setting aspirations. We show that poverty can exacerbate the effects of this behavioural bias leading to aspirations failure and hence, a behavioural poverty trap. Aspirations failure is a consequence of poverty, rather than a cause. We specify the conditions under which raising aspirations alone is sufficient to help escape from a poverty trap, even without relaxing material constraints.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Aspirations,341

10.1093/tcbh/15.2.119,Poverty and Aspiration: Young Women's Entry to Employment in Inter-war England,,"This article examines young women's entry to employment in inter-war England. In doing so, it sheds light on a neglected aspect of their lives—paid work—in a period recently identified by historians as crucial in the emergence of the modern, independent young woman. It is argued that entering employment marked the beginning of a social, cultural, and economic transition from girlhood to womanhood. The relationship between gender, life cycle, and social class in inter-war England is reassessed. The period has been identified as one when a 'traditional' working-class identity was breaking down, with women's relationship to social class viewed as particularly problematic by those historians who have argued domesticity defined inter-war femininity. Contemporary social surveys, the Census and government records, and life histories demonstrate that young women's entry to and choice of employment was influenced by their social background, with kinship and neighbourhood networks used to locate and obtain jobs. Employment expansion increased the state's importance in directing girls to jobs, but poverty continued to constrain employment choice. Awareness of this informed young women's own social aspirations. Interwar femininity and youthful identity formation thus did not signify the decline of social class, but were rather shaped by it.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Aspirations,46

10.5897/ijeaps.9000003,Career development among young people in Britain today: Poverty of aspiration or poverty of opportunity?,,"This paper compares two explanations of the persistent relationship in the UK between young people’s social class backgrounds and their rates of participation in higher education: poverty of aspiration and rational action. It is argued that, rather than widening opportunities, successive reforms in education and training have created a series of blind alleys for the (mostly working class) young people who are not high achievers, and that these experiences are the most likely reason for the subsequent strengthening of the weak relationship that exists at age 11/12 between, on one hand, social class backgrounds, then, on the other, pupils’ educational and vocational aims. The paper then proceeds to argue that at age 16 to 18 high achievers from working class homes are likely to face equally attractive opportunities to the kinds of higher education that they might otherwise enter.

We review literature related to hope from philosophy, theology, and psychology, as well its relationship to emerging work on aspirations in development economics. We then build an economic model of hope based on recent psychology literature that understands hope as a function of aspirations, agency, and pathways. This model of hope illustrates the vital role hope can play in the realization of causal effects from development interventions and how these effects emerge from the impact and interaction of three constituent elements of hope. By clarifying definitions and relationships among these concepts and by leveraging relevant work from other disciplines, we aim to create a framework within which economists can engage in rigorous empirical and experimental work that seeks to better understand the role of hope and aspirations in economic development.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Aspirations,154

Our data and material come from ethnographic work with young men in two slum communities in the country's capital city, Nairobi. While acknowledging that, in their neighborhoods, 'proper' masculinity is constituted in traditional terms of marriage, hardiness, provisioning, breadwinning and self-reliance, youth in our study aspired to masculinities characterized by 'abler' breadwinnerhood, caring, positive emotions, relationality, and the rejection of violence. The masculinity aspirations of poor Nairobi youth are complex; fashioned at the crossroads of structural constraints and agentive projects for a good life, and simultaneously supportive and resistive of traditional hegemonic manliness ideals. These aspirations are limited by and reflect an objective condition of everyday and enduring inequality while also signifying a deep unmet yearning for positive social and livelihood changes.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Aspirations,16

CRT shifts the research lens away from a deficit view of Communities of Color as places full of cultural poverty disadvantages, and instead focuses on and learns from the array of cultural knowledge, skills, abilities and contacts possessed by socially marginalized groups that often go unrecognized and unacknowledged. Various forms of capital nurtured through cultural wealth include aspirational, navigational, social, linguistic, familial and resistant capital. These forms of capital draw on the knowledges Students of Color bring with them from their homes and communities into the classroom. This CRT approach to education involves a commitment to develop schools that acknowledge the multiple strengths of Communities of Color in order to serve a larger purpose of struggle toward social and racial justice.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Aspirations,5862

It reasons that formal education has greatly amplified this trend. Schooling has acquired symbolic value as the prime means of escaping household poverty and realising ambitions for social mobility. As such, elevated educational aspirations combine with systems shortcomings to stimulate school selection, school transfer and school-related child migration.

Based on the 'subjective' stream of entrepreneurship, our model portrays institutional rigidities and contradictions moderating the influence of aspirations on entrepreneurial action by affecting the subjective value that potential entrepreneurs place on their resources. Because the value of resources is subjective in our exposition, our model suggests specific institutional configurations where a change in aspirations among the poor may provide them with unique insights to exploit entrepreneurial opportunities visible only to them. Our 'poor-as-owners' model can be contrasted with interventionist approaches to poverty reduction, which are aimed at creating win-win entrepreneurial models between the poor and the non-poor. Several policy implications can be derived from our paper that may be more effective in achieving regional development and reducing regional disparities that arise from a higher incidence of poverty.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Aspirations,30

The optimal portfolios of BPT investors resemble combinations of bonds and lottery tickets, consistent with Friedman and Savage's (1948) observation. We compare the BPT efficient frontier with the mean-variance efficient frontier and show that, in general, the two frontiers do not coincide. Optimal BPT portfolios are also different from optimal CAPM portfolios. In particular, the CAPM twofund separation does not hold in BPT. We present BPT in a single mental account version (BPT-SA) and a multiple mental account version (BPT-MA). BPT-SA investors integrate their portfolios into a single mental account, while BPT-MA investors segregate their port? folios into several mental accounts. BPT-MA portfolios resemble layered pyramids, where layers are associated with aspirations. We explore a two-layer portfolio where the low aspiration layer is designed to avoid poverty while the high aspiration layer is designed for a shot at riches.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Aspirations,968

10.1080/13639080903453987,Opportunity structures then and now,,"This paper argues that we have a theory – namely, opportunity structure theory – which can account for how school‐to‐work transitions were accomplished 'then' and 'now', and also why 'now' is different from 'then'. Opportunity structures are formed primarily by the inter‐relationships between family backgrounds, education, labour market processes and employers' recruitment practices. The paper describes how each of these structuring agents has changed over time, while emphasising that their combined predictive power is undiminished. Individualisation, together with the requirement that young people make more choices and exhibit reflexivity, are shown to be features of the current structure of opportunities rather than evidence of a weakening of these structures. The paper concludes that 'poverty of aspiration' and young people making the 'wrong choices' cannot explain current imbalances in youth labour markets. Rather, it is argued that the root sources of the imbalances lie in the opportunities within which different groups of young people are required to be reflexive and to make successive choices.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Aspirations,176

In this essay, drawing on fieldwork conducted in Jakarta, Indonesia, San Francisco (California), and Seattle (Washington), we address the question of how a geographic relational poverty approach can help us understand, or at least expand ways of thinking about these processes by attending to urban informality and the politics of poverty. Informality, a pervasive feature of the global South and North, functions as a survival strategy whereby the monetarily poor can compensate for their lack of income through commoning. Market‐driven, state underwritten urban development initiatives for housing those with wealth is limiting the conditions of possibility for the monetarily poor, and informality. This is compounded by emergent political discourses rendering informality as inappropriate, and the monetarily poor as undeserving of a right to the city. Yet long‐standing more‐than‐capitalist and communal informal practices pursued by the urban poor remain effective and necessary survival strategies, supporting residents whose presence is necessary to the city and whose practices challenge capitalist norms.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Aspirations,36
10.1017/s1474746410000102,"Migration and Care: Themes, Concepts and Challenges",,"The phenomenon of migrant workers finding domestic and care work in the homes and institutions of countries wealthier than their own uncovers much about social change in the twenty-first century. First, it reveals the consequences of women taking on more responsibilities to earn income but without a significant rebalancing of their care responsibilities either with male partners or through state support. In the poorer regions of the world, unemployment, violence, poverty and aspirations for a better life push some women into emigrating to earn for their families. This also exposes an asymmetrical geopolitical solution to the so-called ‘care deficit’ pursued by richer states, accentuated by the demographics of ageing societies and restructured welfare regimes on the one side, and the care crises in the poorer regions on the other. The transnational movement of (mainly) women into care and domestic work, as well as nurses, pharmacists and doctors into health care saves social expenditure costs while intensifying the lack of care resources in the countries of origin of those migrant workers.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Aspirations,170

We find that mother aspirations are strongly related to the child's grade achieved at age 18. The relation is nonlinear, suggesting there is a threshold, and depends on caste, household income and the village setting. The coefficients remain large and significant when applying control function estimation, using first born son as instrument. A similar strong relation is observed with learning outcomes, including local language, English and maths test results, and with attending school, but not with attending private education. These results are confirmed for outcomes at age 15. The findings provide direct evidence on the contribution of mother aspirations to children's education outcomes and point to aspirations as a channel of intergenerational mobility. They suggest that education outcomes can be improved more rapidly by taking aspirations into account when targeting education programmes, and through interventions that shape aspirations.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Aspirations,11

10.1080/13676261.2010.538043,‘Becoming somebody’: youth transitions through education and migration in Peru,,"Abstract The past few decades have witnessed international pressure to get more children in the world educated, for longer. The view that school education is core to definitions of good childhoods and successful youth transitions is increasingly widespread, globally and locally. However, structural inequalities persist and migration for education has become an important individual, family and community response to overcome these gaps. This article explores the relationship between migration and educational aspirations among a group of young people participating in Young Lives, an international study of child poverty, in Peru. It draws on survey and qualitative data collected on a cohort of children being tracked by the study over a 15-year period, from the time they were 8 years old (2002) into early adulthood (2017). Young people and their parents connect migration with the process of ‘becoming somebody in life’ and with their high educational aspirations. This is linked to intergenerational dependencies and the roles that children play in mitigating family poverty. Their aspirations are generated against a country backdrop of economic and social inequalities, a recent history of political violence and resulting mass displacement, and established and diverse patterns of internal and international migration.

In Afghanistan, the burden of poor mental health arises in contexts of pervasive poverty, social inequality, and persistent violence. In 2006, we conducted face-to-face interviews with 1011 children (age 11-16) and 1011 adult caregivers, randomly selected in a school-based survey in three northern and central areas. Participants narrated their experiences as part of a systematic health survey, including an open-ended questionnaire on major life stressors and solutions to mitigate them. Responses were analysed using an inductive thematic approach and categorised for quantitative presentation, producing a conceptual model. For adults, the primary concern is repairing their ""broken economy,"" the root of all miseries in social, educational, governance, and health domains. For students, frustrations focus on learning environments as well as poverty, as education is perceived as the gateway to upward social and economic mobility. Hope arises from a sense of moral and social order embodied in the expression of key cultural values: faith, family unity, service, effort, morals, and honour. These values form the bedrock of resilience, drive social aspirations, and underpin self-respect and dignity. However, economic impediments, social expectations, and cultural dictates also combine to create entrapment, as the ability to realise personal and social aspirations is frustrated by structural inequalities injurious to health and wellbeing. This study contributes to a small but growing body of work on resilience in public health and conflict settings. It demonstrates that culture functions both as an anchor for resilience and an anvil of pain, and highlights the relevance of ethnographic work in identifying what matters most in formulating social and public health policies to promote a hopeful future.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Aspirations,373

This should improve the capabilities of policy analysts and others working to reduce poverty, but it also makes analysis more complex.

This simple schema explicitly recognises the dynamic aspirations of poor people, diversity among them, and livelihood diversification. It also brings together aspirations of poor people with wider sectoral, inter-sectoral, and macro-economic questions about policies necessary for the realisation of those aspirations.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Aspirations,227

Yet such perceptions are based on stereotypes rather than theoretically informed empirical research. Drawing on the migration and visa databases from the Determinants of International Migration (DEMIG project) and the Global Bilateral Migration Database (GBMD), this paper explores the evolution and drivers of migration within, towards and from Africa in the post-colonial period. Contradicting common ideas of Africa as a 'continent on the move', the analysis shows that intra-African migration intensities have gone down. This may be related to state formation and the related imposition of barriers towards free movement in the wake of decolonisation as well as the concomitant rise of nationalism and inter-state tensions. While African migration remains overwhelmingly intra-continental, since the late 1980s there has been an acceleration and spatial diversification (beyond colonial patterns) of emigration out of Africa to Europe, North America, the Gulf and Asia. This diversification of African emigration seems partly driven by the introduction of visa and other immigration restrictions by European states. Contradicting conventional interpretations of African migration being essentially driven by poverty, violence and underdevelopment, increasing migration out of Africa seems rather to be driven by processes of development and social transformation which have increased Africans' capabilities and aspirations to migrate, a trend which is likely to continue in the future.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Aspirations,423

10.1111/ciso.12145,Housing the Contingent Life Course: Domestic Aspiration and Extreme Poverty in Peruvian Shantytowns,,"Abstract Peru's urban peripheries have long been shaped by the intertwining of urban development policies with Peruvians' domestic aspirations. Since the 1960s, different formulations of progressive and self‐help housing policies have relied on and reproduced a domestic life course model in which Peruvians' inexorable progress through the “domestic cycle” is mirrored in the steady transformation of their precarious, unconsolidated shantytown homes into “noble” (modern; concrete) constructions in fully urbanized neighborhoods. While shantytowns partially reflect this predictable life course temporality, they are also shaped by future imaginings and contingent time. People use shantytowns to fulfill ideals of adulthood, autonomy, and success, but also to hedge their bets, retreating from some relations while striving to forge new ones. Drawing on twenty‐one months of fieldwork in Peruvian shantytowns, this article examines informal urban development from a contingent life course perspective to demonstrate how Peru's urban peripheries are embedded in and shaped by Peruvians' efforts to pursue domestic life projects while managing fluctuating kin relations and preparing for uncertain futures.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Aspirations,11

Drawing on empirical evidence collected through qualitative research in the northeast of Brazil, it traces notions of intergenerational change and continuity amongst young recipients of the Bolsa Família programme (BFP) and their families. It argues that the BFP has contributed to raising expectations and aspirations of social mobility, through a policy narrative that explicitly links education to poverty reduction alongside some relatively limited but nonetheless significant intergenerational changes in material conditions and access to education. However, rising aspirations have not been matched by a concomitant expansion of opportunities available to poor young people in education and the labour market. The article thus highlights the contradictions that arise between policy narratives, the aspirations these narratives engender, and the realities of young people's everyday lives.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Aspirations,6
10.3390/su12083359,Mapping the Sustainable Development Goals Relationships,,"Sustainable development addresses humanity’s aspiration for a better life while observing the limitations imposed by nature. In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly approved the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the aim to foster the organizational operationalization and integration of sustainability and, therefore, to address the current and forthcoming stakeholder needs and ensure a better and sustainable future for all, balancing the economic, social, and environmental development. However, it is not entirely clear which are the mutual relationships among the 17 SDGs and this study aims to tackle this research gap. The results of the correlation confirm that Poverty elimination (SDG1) and Good health and well-being (SDG3) have synergetic relationships with most of the other goals. SDG7 (Affordable and clean energy) has significant relationships with other SDGs (e.g., SDG1 (No poverty), SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG3 (Good health and well-being), SDG8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG13 (Climate action)). However, there is a moderate negative correlation with SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production), which emphasizes the need to improve energy efficiency, increase the share of clean and renewable energies and improve sustainable consumption patterns worldwide. There is also confirmation that SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production) is the goal strongly associated with trade-offs. To sum up, this research suggests that change towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals offers many opportunities for reinforcing rather than inhibiting itself. However, some SDGs show no significant correlation with other SDGs (e.g., SDG13 (Climate action) and SDG17 (Partnerships for the goals), which highlights the need for future research.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Aspirations,420

With age and family composition held constant, time preference rates vary from 12 percent for white, college-educated families in the top 5 percent of the labor income distribution to 19 percent for nonwhite families without a college education whose labor incomes are in the bottom fifth percentile. Such differences imply very different patterns of consumption over the life cycle and suggest one possible explanation for observed heterogeneity in savings behavior across socioeconomic classes.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Time preference,926
10.1017/s1355770x98000060,"Poverty, market imperfections and time preferences: of relevance for environmental policy?",,"Rates of time preference (RTPs) of rural households in Indonesia, Zambia and Ethiopia have been measured using hypothetical questions about preferences for current versus future consumption. In general, the rates were found to be very high. Factors influencing or correlated with the personal rates of time preference were investigated through regression methods. OLS was the technique used in the estimation. Market imperfections, particularly in credit and insurance markets lead to variation in RTPs. Poverty in assets, or cash liquidity constraints, was leading to or correlated with higher rates of time preference. The poor are, therefore, less likely to invest in environmental conservation. In Zambia, independent estimates of risk preferences were made. More risk-averse people tended to have lower RTPs. The results support the hypothesis that poverty and/or liquidity scarcity lead to high RTPs. Poverty reduction may thus reduce the RTPs of the poor and reduce the 'intertemporal externality' due to high RTPs. The high average RTPs indicate, however, that complementary policies may be needed to ensure sufficient levels of investment in conservation. Another logical implication is that institutionalization of private property rights may not be a sufficient tool to initiate sustainable resource management.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Time preference,298

The variation of time preference causes the economy to have multiple steady states, some of which are similar to poverty traps. The stability properties of these steady states are analyzed.

An individual's probability of survival is assumed to be dependent on past levels of consumption. Endogenous probability of survival implies that the rate of time preference (or degree of patience) of an individual is endogenously determined. We solve the dynamic optimization problem facing an agent and provide a complete characterization of the steady states and their stability properties. We find that with endogenous rate of time preference an economy may have multiple steady state equilibria. The equilibrium an economy converges to depends on its initial conditions. The results are interpreted in light of the growth experiences of developing economies. The model can explain why two economies that have identical production technologies and identical preferences may converge to different levels of income depending on initial conditions.

10.2139/ssrn.1646411,Choosing Dimensions: The Capability Approach and Multidimensional Poverty,,"The capability approach defines poverty as a deprivation of capabilities, as a lack of multiple freedoms people value and have reason to value. Chronic poverty focuses attention on that subset of poor persons whose capability deprivations endure across time. But how should the dimensions of chronic poverty be selected? This question is complex because the relevant dimensions must in some sense be chosen at the start of a study, and yet preferences or values may change. Nussbaum argues that there should be a 'list' of core capabilities; Sen argues that the capabilities should be selected in light of the purpose of the study and the values of the referent populations, and that their selection should be explicit and open to public debate and scrutiny. In the literature, if authors give any justification at all of their selection (many do not), they justify it on the basis of up to five criteria. This paper argues that the dimensions of chronic poverty for research studies should be selected using a 'mixed' method approach that combines the selection of a static set of core dimensions (using explicit criteria which are described) with participatory studies that report the relative importance of each dimensions to the respondents during different waves of the survey.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Time preference,257

Social policies likely affect terrorism in offsetting ways but, on balance, should diminish preferences for terrorism by reducing economic insecurity, inequality, poverty, and religious-political extremism. Thus, countries with more generous welfare provisions should suffer fewer terrorist attacks on their soil and have fewer of their citizens perpetrate terrorism. Supporting this argument, cross-sectional estimation reveals that a country's welfare efforts negatively correlate with transnational or total terrorist incidents on its soil, as well as transnational terrorism perpetrated by its citizens. Pooled cross-section time-series estimation reveals that several measures of welfare effort reduce the incidence of transnational terrorism in countries, robust to a range of estimators and controls. Such findings suggest that strengthening social policies at home and abroad may not only serve redistributive or development goals but also help combat terrorist violence.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Time preference,309

Following maize market deregulation and subsequent entry of private buyers in the Zimbabwean grain sector, marginalised poor farmers remained confined to the low return private buyer market that offered very low prices, as they avoided GMB whose payment plan was uncertain and delayed. The question therefore was: To what extent did farmers' risk aversion attitude and time preference explain the poor farmers' choice for low return private buyer market at the expense of the high return GMB market? Using survey data obtained from 433 maize farmers in Makonde and Zvimba districts, an instrumental variable probit regression model was estimated. The results confirmed that risk aversion attitude and time preferences (as measured by farmers' discount rate) reduced the likelihood of a farmer participating in a high return state-owned GMB market. Poor farmers were found to be more risk averse and impatient than non-poor farmers in marketing channel selection. Their high risk aversion attitude and impatience constituted the greatest market impediments that restricted them to the low return private buyer market. To make agricultural markets work for poverty reduction the study recommended that policies that promote the development of risk transfer markets and futures markets for maturity transformation of farmers' payments are critical in guaranteeing effective participation of poor households in high return markets.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Time preference,4

The default academic response to this pattern is often the deficit model: Poverty damages or impairs brain function, which leads to poor performance that only exacerbates the poverty. Deficits and damage are real phenomena. However, there are also other processes: People living in poverty may have made reasonable psychological responses to their circumstances or may have developed strengths that enhance their ability to cope with challenges in their lives.

10.1080/13545701.2010.508574,Working Long Hours and Having No Choice: Time Poverty in Guinea,,"Abstract Abstract This contribution provides a new definition of time poverty as working long hours without choice because an individual's household is poor or would be at risk of falling into poverty if the individual reduced her working hours below a certain time-poverty line. Time poverty is thus understood as the lack of enough time for rest and leisure after accounting for the time that has to be spent working, whether in the labor market, doing domestic work, or performing other activities such as fetching water and wood. The study applies the concepts used in the traditional poverty literature to measure time poverty defined in this new way to analyze its determinants in Guinea from 2002 to 2003. It finds that women are more likely to be time poor than men in Guinea, and even more so according to this new definition. Keywords: Time useemploymentunderemploymentpovertyGuinea ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Earlier versions of this paper were presented at the Workshop on Time Use in 2005 (World Bank, Washington, DC), the IAFFE session at the ASSA Meeting in 2009 (San Francisco), and at the Special Issue on Time Use and Public Policy Workshop in 2009 (American University, Washington, DC). We thank all the attendees at these presentations – in particular Kathleen Beegle, Diane Elson, Maria Floro, Caren Grown, Susan Himmelweit, and Paul Winters – for their helpful feedback. We also thank the four anonymous reviewers of Feminist Economics, whose useful input improved our work greatly. This work was prepared with funding from the Gender Action Plan at the World Bank for work on gender, time use, and infrastructure in Africa. The views expressed here are those of the authors and need not reflect those of the World Bank, its Executive Directors, or the countries they represent. Notes 1 They calculate that women worked roughly 15 hours longer each week than men and that, over a year, they worked an extra month of 24-hour days. 2 According to the 1995 Human Development Report (United Nations Development Programme 1995 United Nations Development Programme. 1995. Human Development Report 1995, New York: Oxford University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]), using data from a sample of thirty-one countries, women's share in total work was 53 percent in developing countries and 51 percent in industrial countries. Moreover, the distribution of women's time was two-thirds in unpaid work and only one-third in paid work; for men, these percentages are reversed. In developing countries, men were found to spend even less time in unpaid work. 3 We use ""freedom of choice"" in a simplistic way to mean a broader set of options. Obviously, the definition of what this means in practice is not straightforward. One possibility is to use a concept of minimum necessary time (an absolute time-poverty line) and calculate all possible combinations of time and income that the individual can generate by working different numbers of hours and purchasing different amounts of replacement services, while still meeting minimum obligations (see Burchardt 2008 Burchardt, Tania. Time and Income Poverty. CASE Report 57. London: Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion (CASE), London School of Economics. [Google Scholar]). Other alternative definitions of ""freedom of choice"" are possible; for example, one could calculate the share of time spent providing for basic needs over the total time spent as an indicator that helps distinguish people who work long hours by necessity versus ""free choice"" (we thank one of the referees for this suggestion). It should be noted, however, that the actual time spent in meeting basic needs when used as an indicator of the constraints faced by household members in the use of their time is itself dependent on the poverty status of the household. That is, the fact that very poor people spend a great deal of time on the fulfillment of basic needs is in part due to their poverty, which prevents them from living in areas with access to piped-in water, so that they need to spend significant time fetching water; this in turn results in less time for paid work (as noted by a referee, poor people's time allocations are devoted first to activities that fulfill their basic needs, which is an outcome of their revealed preference functions, as noted by Nicky R. M. Pouw 2008 Pouw, Nicky R.M. 2008. The Characterization and Monitoring of Poverty: Smallholder Farmers in Rural Uganda, Amsterdam: Rozenberg. [Google Scholar]). Another issue is that some among the poor have very few options in the paid labor market and may end up spending more time in basic needs activities simply because they are underemployed. 4 Makdissi and Wodon (2004 Makdissi, Paul and Wodon, Quentin. 2004. ""Robust Comparisons of Natural Resources Depletion Indices."". Economics Bulletin, 9(2): 1–9. [Google Scholar]) show that the approach to robust comparisons for poverty measurement using stochastic dominance may be adapted to indicators where excess (for example, polluting more than a benchmark of what is acceptable), as opposed to insufficiency (for example, consuming less than what is needed for basic needs), is considered as welfare-reducing. 5 This is a nationally representative and somewhat standard priority survey with detailed modules on household composition, income, consumption, education, and health, among others. The survey also includes a time-use module. The survey includes data on 7,611 households; but 516 households were deleted from the analysis for various reasons, leading to poor data for these households. 6 We preferred this variable to the alternative ""female-headed household"" because many female-headed households in Guinea include several adult men. 7 While it is obvious that availability of or proximity to water and electricity can save women several hours a week, there are virtually no studies that show how the saved time would be spent, and in particular whether this time would be spent in (decently) paid work. In other words, while infrastructural policies are clearly necessary, it is less apparent whether lack of infrastructure is the binding constraint to poverty or if other policies would be required.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Time preference,130

A series of cross-sectional analyses of geographical and social determinants of poverty rates and median household income are used to analyse whether the determinants are changing over time. Large, older central cities in the north-east and mid-west have experienced increasing poverty and decreases in income relative to their own history and relative to their own suburbs. There is some evidence of economic decline in the inner suburbs of these central cities relative to other suburbs, but not relative to the central cities. The geographical shifts in MSA population among suburbs by income between 1970 and 1990 are analysed relative to initial social characteristics of civil divisions. The study concludes that the filtering of older residential buildings to, and the lower marginal preference for land of, lower-income groups contributes to the rising poverty rates and decreases in median household income for all central cities and for the inner suburbs of the north-eastern and mid-western MSAs. The study finds little evidence that either 'white flight' or the non-poor's avoidance of taxes to support the poor are important factors in the shifts of population among suburbs.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Time preference,90

Anthropometric indicators can therefore complement (but not replace) standard indicators of income/consumption poverty, especially for comparisons across subgroups, within households, across countries, and in the long run. In addition, the paper analyses spells of change in malnutrition over time, finding that the association between economic growth and chronic child malnutrition is very small (but statistically significant) and much lower than the elasticity of growth on poverty.

10.1016/j.nfs.2019.11.002,Benefits and food safety concerns associated with consumption of edible insects,,"Many types of edible insects in raw and processed forms have been consumed by many cultures globally since time immemorial, particularly in developing countries where they are mostly traditionally viewed as a delicacy besides provision of nutrition. As a food type, they are consumed in two main forms; whole insects or incorporated in various food products as an ingredient, the choice of which is consumer preference driven. Recently, there has been a lot of research interest in edible insects farming, processing and consumption mainly in an effort to eradicate food insecurities prevalent in many developing countries and boost nutrition. Inclusion of edible insects in human diets has been shown to improve the nutritional quality of foods due to their high micro- and macronutrient levels comparable and sometimes higher than those of animal-derived foods. It is in this regard that they can actually be used in directly addressing the first three UN's Sustainable Development Goals (no poverty, zero hunger, and good health and well-being). Edible insects production also helps in mitigating the negative effects of climate change and improve biodiversity both of which positively contributes to food security. Even with all these benefits, several challenges are encountered in the promotion of edible insects farming and consumption in developing and developed countries. Top in the list of these obstacles is the issue of food safety where, especially western consumers willing to consume edible insects and/or edible insects-derived foods are wary of the microbiological and chemical health risk they could pose. Based on the current literature, there is clearly a need to balance the food safety concerns and the nutritional benefits of edible insects. There is a necessity to promote food safety and hygiene practices in the entire edible insect value chain including during wild harvesting in order to ensure that this highly nutritious food that requires little resources to produce is availed to the consumers in a state that does not pose any health risks. Lack of regulations on edible insects value chain which lacks in many countries, especially developing countries is also another problem that requires urgent attention as addressing this issue is likely to boost consumer confidence and ease trade of this commodity between countries.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Time preference,297

10.1111/j.1574-0864.2006.00117.x,"Tenure security, resource poverty, public programs, and household plot‐level conservation investments in the highlands of northern Ethiopia",,"Abstract Land degradation poses a serious problem for the livelihoods of rural producers. Furthermore, there is rarely enough private investment taking place to commensurate the scale of the problem. This article examines the role of tenure insecurity, resource poverty, risk and time preferences, and community‐led land conservation on differentiated patterns of household investment in land conservation in northern Ethiopia. We control for biophysical, household characteristics, market access conditions, and village level factors. Investments in soil bunds and stone terraces are specifically studied so as to capture the link between these various factors and the durability of conservation investments. We introduce the distinction between the determinants of the decision to invest and how much to invest in conservation. Regression results show that publicly led conservation programs seem to significantly stimulate private investment. A host of plot‐level variables and household perceptions of returns on conservation investments, expressed in terms of perceived improvements in land quality and increased crop yields, were found to be critical to the decision to invest and intensify soil conservation. The evidence on the significance of households' attitudes toward risk aversion suggests the important role of risk and the household's risk‐bearing capacity in the decision to intensify conservation measures. At the same time, tenure security indicators and households' resource endowments (resource poverty) had weaker effects in increasing willingness to invest and the level of investment made. The policy implications of these results point to the importance of agricultural research and extension efforts that target technologies which reduce household risk and poverty while enabling sustainable investments in conservation measures by individual households.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Time preference,70
10.1111/j.1467-9833.2009.01445.x,"Climate Change and the Future: Discounting for Time, Wealth, and Risk",,"There is no quality in human nature, which causes more fatal errors in our conduct, than that which leads us to prefer whatever is present to the distant and remote, and makes us desire objects more according to their situation than their intrinsic value.1 It is widely recognized that the Earth's climate is undergoing profound changes. The most authoritative analysis is that produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In its most recent report, the Fourth Assessment Report, the IPCC confirmed that the Earth's climate is getting warmer and is projected to continue to do so. The report employs six different scenarios. According to these six scenarios, the likely increase in temperature ranges from 1.1°C to 6.4°C and the likely increase in sea level ranges from 0.18 meters to 0.59 meters.2 Climate change will have very severe impacts on many people—producing poverty, disease, instability, and death from freak weather events. It will, in particular, have dire consequences for members of developing countries. I have argued elsewhere that it jeopardizes fundamental human rights.3 In light of this, there is a strong case for engaging in a vigorous policy of mitigation. Some, however, query this, arguing that many of the impacts of climate change will be felt in the future and that future disadvantages can be discounted. My purpose in this paper is to explore the issues of intergenerational equity raised by climate change. To do so, it is necessary to start with a recognition of the intergenerational nature of anthropogenic climate change. Greenhouse gases have a long life span and emissions at one time can exert a considerable influence on events decades, even millennia, later. To take the example of carbon dioxide: molecules of carbon dioxide can last for very different time periods, depending on whether they are located in the atmosphere or near the surface of the ocean or deep in the ocean. The average lifetime is approximately one hundred years.4 The emission of greenhouse gases thus raises questions of intergenerational, as well as international, equity. What obligations do we owe to future generations? May we (should we) apply a positive social discount rate and devote more resources to our contemporaries than to future generations? The answers to these questions make a considerable difference not simply to whether current generations should engage in mitigation or not. Suppose that we think (as very many do) that some mitigation is necessary, the social discount rate also bears on the question of how much current generations should mitigate and this remains hotly contested. To ask by how much current generations should lower emissions requires one to assess their interests with the legitimate interests of future people and so the question of whether a discount rate should be applied to future generations is crucial here. As many have emphasized, the resources to be spent on combating climate change (both the funds that should be spent on adaptation and the opportunities foregone by mitigating) could be spent on other contemporary problems—including malaria, AIDS, malnutrition, and global poverty.5 A number of different reasons have been suggested as to why current generations may legitimately favor devoting resources to contemporaries rather than to future generations. These—either individually or jointly—challenge the case for combating climate change. In this paper, I distinguish between three different kinds of reason for favoring contemporaries. I argue that none of these arguments is persuasive. My answer in each case appeals to the concept of human rights. It maintains that a human rights-centered perspective to climate change enables us to address each of these reasons. To address the question of how current generations should make decisions which bear on the interests of future people, it is essential to introduce the concept of a social discount rate.6 This concept has been discussed by economists from Alfred Marshall, A. C. Pigou, and Frank Ramsey to contemporary economists like Sir Nicholas Stern.7 It refers to the rate by which the claims of future generations to resources currently held by current generations diminishes or increases or remains constant over time. A social discount rate, thus, determines the extent to which resources should be devoted to people's interests now in preference to people's interests at a later date.8 The higher the positive social discount rate the less should be spent on the future. To explicate the concept further and relate it to the issue of climate change, it is useful to have some figures in front of us. The Stern Review has famously argued that the cost of attaining a stabilization level of 550 pm CO2e, thereby mitigating climate change, amounts to approximately one percent of global GDP per annum.9 Eric Neumayer calculates that, in practice, this would require an outlay of $350 billion per annum rising to a figure of $1000 billion by 2050.10 So the question to be examined is whether this sum is better spent on current generations or on future generations. Why might one legitimately hold that the money should be spent on current generations rather than future ones? Standard analyses of the social discount rate comprise four separate components, each of which shall be dealt with in turn. A. First, there is what economists call pure time preference. Some hold that it is appropriate to ascribe a lower weight to human interests the further they are in the future just because of the fact that they exist in the future. Thus, one reason for adopting a social discount rate is that one thinks it appropriate to reflect pure time preference. Pigou, Ramsey and, more recently, Sir Nicholas Stern have argued that pure time preference is morally illegitimate.11 Similarly, Roy Harrod famously says that ""pure time preference [is] a polite expression for rapacity and the conquest of reason by passion.""12 On his view, it is ""a human infirmity.""13 Henry Sidgwick takes a similar view, stating that ""the time at which a man exists cannot affect the value of his happiness from a universal point of view; and that the interests of posterity must concern a Utilitarian as much as those of his contemporaries.""14 Pure time preference, however, is far from being the only relevant consideration. B. Second, we need to ascertain the correct principle of intergenerational equity. Suppose that one holds that there should not be any pure time preference. One might still permissibly decide to devote resources to current people over future people for a second reason, depending on what principle of intergenerational equity one adopts. One way to see this is to set intergenerational matters to one side for a moment. Consider a theory of justice that applies solely to a current generation. It will have several component parts. First, it has to decide whether all persons have equal moral status or whether some have greater moral standing than others. (In the intergenerational context, those who subscribe to pure time discounting are rejecting the principle of equal moral standing.) Now once we have determined this first issue we then have to decide what distributive principle applies. Should it be economic equality or a Rawlsian difference principle or libertarianism or a desert theory or a sufficientarian approach or something else? Now the same question applies at the intergenerational level. Once the issue of time discounting has been addressed, we then need to identify whether relations between generations should be determined by a principle of equality or maximizing the good or whatever the market produces or something else. The key point is that one might hold that current generations should devote resources to current generations in preference to future generations because of the distributive principle one affirms. C. Risk and Uncertainty. The considerations adduced so far do not exhaust the reasons why one might devote resources to current generations over future generations. Two additional reasons to do so arise from each generation's lack of sure knowledge of future generations. First, we lack sure knowledge of the impacts of climate change. Second, we lack sure knowledge that human life will continue to exist. For example, the Stern Review on The Economic of Climate Change discounts by 0.1 percent per annum to reflect the possibility that humanity might die out for nonclimate-related reasons.15 Clearly, it matters what changes to the environment (rising sea levels and temperature increases) occur and how likely each possible scenario is. It also matters if humanity disappears because of some nonclimate-related calamity. If humanity dies out for nonclimate-related reasons, then one reason for being concerned about climate change (its impact on human life) no longer applies.16 Now if, for either reason, one is not certain that there will be malign effects on human life then, so it might be argued, there is a case for discounting the amount which one is going to spend on preventing a calamity from possibly taking place. Before proceeding further it is worth noting the distinction between ""risk,"" on the one hand, and ""uncertainty,"" on the other. Risk refers to cases where one identifies an outcome and can determine the probability that it will occur. Uncertainty, on the other hand, refers to cases where one identifies an outcome but is not able to determine the probability of its coming to pass.17 Both might give us reason for discounting, but they are importantly different. For example, if one has reliable probabilistic assessments to hand, then one can calculate the expected utility and makes one's decision on that basis. Where, though, we face uncertainty this course of action is unavailable to us. * Putting this together, then, we see that the extent to which people may devote resources to the present as opposed to the future is a function of the following four variables: (1) the legitimacy of pure time preference (may we accord less weight to their interests?); (2) the principles of intergenerational justice (what principles of justice govern the relations between people over time?); (3) the certainty of the harmful effects (will these dangerous changes happen?); and (4) the certainty of human existence (are we sure that what we are doing will result in threats to human beings?). Let us now consider one factor in the social discount rate and analyze one common argument for prioritizing current generations over future generations that focuses on this one variable. The first argument to be scrutinized makes the following claim: Argument 1: Current generations should prioritize current generations over the interests of future generations because it is permissible (and maybe even morally required) for current people to engage in pure time preference. Argument 1 defends a positive pure time discount rate. If we accept it, it follows that current generations should spend less on mitigation and adaptation than if they adopt a zero pure time discount rate. In what follows I shall reject this view and defend an alternative. Before I introduce the view to be defended, it is worth drawing attention to the possibilities. Some apply a zero pure time discount rate to all values. As was noted earlier, Pigou, Ramsey, Sidgwick, Stern, and others have argued for the correctness of this view. A second group has defended a positive pure time discount rate. What both views have in common is their assumption that one should treat all values in the same way. All values should be subjected to exactly the same (positive, negative, or zero) pure time discount rate. A third position is, however, worth considering. This view adopts what might be termed a Scope Restricted Pure Time Discount Rate (or more simply, the Scope Restricted View). This applies a zero pure time discount rate to some values but not to others. Stated more fully, the Scope Restricted View has three features. First, it posits that there is a plurality of different values. Second, it affirms what I shall term the Rights Principle. This holds that persons have human rights to the protection of fundamental human interests from the threats posed by dangerous climate change. Climate change jeopardizes various human rights including, for example: (1) the right to life (since storm surges, flooding and freak weather events, and heat stress will all lead to human deaths); (2) the right to subsistence (since the increase in temperatures, increased flooding, and rising sea levels will lead to crop failure and therefore malnutrition); (3) the right to health (since climate change will lead to increased exposure to vector-borne diseases (like malaria) and water-borne diseases (like dengue and diarrhea); (4) the right to property (since flooding, sea-level rise, and freak weather events may destroy people's privately and collectively owned property); and (5) the right not to be subject to enforced relocation (since sea-level rises will force inhabitants of coastal settlements or small island states to move).18 The Rights Principle calls then for the nonviolation, and the protection, of these vital rights—all of which are threatened by dangerous climate change.19 There are a number of different ways of grounding these rights. I here assume that they are justified on the grounds that they protect vital human interests that are sufficient to generate duties on others.20 Now the third part of the view to be defended holds that a zero pure time discount rate should be applied to the Rights Principle, but it need not be applied to other political principles or values. Human rights that are jeopardized by climate change should thus be secured (with no discrimination against those further off in time), but other more marginal interests (like being able to travel to interesting countries, or, more generally, the interest in satisfying preferences) may be subject to a positive pure time discount rate. Current generations should then act so as not to bring about a state of affairs in which people in one hundred years' time are unable to exercise their rights, but might be allowed to weight future people's interests in preference satisfaction, say, less than current people's interest in preference satisfaction. Note that my version of the Scope Restricted View is not committed to calling for (or rejecting) a positive pure time discount rate for other values such as preference satisfaction. It simply allows the possibility that that might be the case. My emphasis is more on the first part: We may not discount current and future people's vital rights if, when and because the threat to them from climate change is further off in the future.21 A. Thus far, I have described the Scope Restricted View but not defended the approach to pure time preference that it adopts. I now wish to motivate some support for the claim that the rights jeopardized by climate change should not be subject to a positive pure time discount rate and hence why Argument 1 fails. Let us consider then what reasons might support a zero pure time discount rate. The most common argument is one originally presented by William Stanley Jevons and later defended by A. C. Pigou. In The Theory of Political Economy, Jevons writes: ""To secure a maximum of benefit in life, all future events, all future pleasures or pains, should act upon us with the same force as if they were present, allowance being made for their uncertainty. The factor expressing the effect of remoteness should, in short, always be unity, so that time should have no influence.""22 Jevons's argument, then, is that the ""maximum of benefit"" requires not according greater weight to a unit of pleasure because it is nearer in time. To prefer a smaller unit of utility at t1 to a greater unit of utility at t2 would lead to a suboptimal level of utility. We find the same argument in Pigou's seminal The Economics of Welfare. It is on the basis of this argument that he concludes that pure time preference is a failure of rationality: in his words, ""our telescopic faculty is defective.""23 Clearly, this argument will not provide a defense of the Scope Restricted View outlined previously. Moreover, even if we set this aside, the limitations of this argument are fairly clear. It presupposes a maximizing consequentialism and for very familiar reasons (its indifference to the distribution of goods and its insensitivity to individual rights) I think that that position is unacceptable. Indeed, the argument exemplifies and illustrates a deep flaw in any maximizing doctrine. Consider the situation of an individual who is born in the future. The Jevons–Pigou argument would provide such a person with greater protection than they would be afforded by a positive pure time discount rate. However, note that that outcome is not animated by a commitment to the individual per se. Jevons's and Pigou's argument does aid the condition of future people but it does so only indirectly. Its direct concern is with increasing the total amount of well-being and it happens that a zero pure time discount rate furthers that goal. It illustrates well Rawls's objection that utilitarianism treats each individual merely as ""a container-person.""24 Given the problems with this argument, let us consider an alternative argument. B. A second objection to Argument 1 appeals (at a general level) to the ideal of impartiality and then (more specifically) to the logic underlying the Rights Principle. Consider impartiality first. The ideal of impartiality insists that political decisions should not reward or penalize people on the grounds of personal properties that lack any fundamental moral relevance. It is on this basis that we hold that persons should not be discriminated against because of their race or gender or socioeconomic class. These factors do not correspond to any morally relevant features of persons. In the same way, however, it seems inappropriate to discriminate against a person simply because of their location in time, for that seems equally arbitrary. It may be appropriate to favor some in some circumstances—if they are more deserving or more needy or they some possess other morally relevant property—but simply being born further into the future is not one of these properties. Put the other way round: being born earlier in time is just not the right kind of property to justify favoritism. To illustrate this point, we may consider Sidgwick's defense of a zero pure time discount rate for this exemplifies the kind of reasoning advocated by the impartiality argument. Sidgwick's argument appeals to what is of fundamental importance from a utilitarian point of view (namely, ""utility"") and deduces the appropriate pure time discount rate from that. Given that all that matters is the promotion of utility, it follows that ""the time at which a man exists cannot affect the value of his happiness from a universal point of view; and that the interests of posterity must concern a Utilitarian as much as those of his contemporaries.""25 This Impartiality Argument can similarly be applied to the reasoning underlying the Rights Principle. Consider again the fundamental tenets of the theory. The argument for the protection of core rights invokes an orthodox conception of rights (in my case Raz's ""interest theory"").26 The latter ascribes rights to agents when this protects an interest that is sufficient to impose duties on others. This, note, makes no reference to time. All that matters is the possession of fundamental interests and the reasonableness of the demands made on others, where that might include how demanding those demands are, whether it is unfairly burdening people, and so on. Time is not a morally relevant consideration. The logic of the case for rights entails, therefore, that there should be a zero pure time discount rate for the protection of rights. Put otherwise, a theory of justice animated by the dignity of persons and respect for their interests contains in it no room for ascribing lesser protection of these rights for some than for others. This argument thus defends the application of zero pure time discount rate to the protection of rights. Note, moreover, that the argument under scrutiny does not commit us to applying a zero pure time discount rate to any other values. It simply appeals to the rationale underlying rights and argues that these do not allow any pure time discounting. As such it is, of course, silent on what kind of pure time discount rate is appropriate for other values. In short, this argument justifies the Scope Restricted View defined earlier in this section (II.A).27 * It would be useful at this point to take stock and to return to the case of climate change. I have defended a zero pure time discount rate for the protection of the human rights jeopardized by climate change. This is supported by the Impartiality Argument (and an examination of the rationale underlying rights). This conclusion has considerable importance for climate change because the latter jeopardizes key rights. Given that these should receive equal weighting throughout time this strengthens the case for an aggressive program of mitigation. Let us now turn to a second type of argument for devoting resources to current people over future people. Consider the following common argument: Argument 2: Future generations will be wealthier than current generations and it is therefore more appropriate for current generations to devote resources to their contemporaries rather than to future people. It follows that it would be wrong to mitigate on behalf of future generations when they will be much better off than us.28 This is not an argument for pure time discounting. It is an argument for thinking that even if those who are currently alive weight future people's well-being as equal in standing to that of their contemporaries, they should devote more resources to their contemporaries because current generations are worse off than future generations will be.29 It makes the case for what William Nordhaus calls ""growth discounting.""30 Broken down into its constituent parts, this argument claims: It is wrong to devote resources to future generations rather than to current generations if future generations are wealthier than current generations. Future generations will be wealthier than current generations. Therefore, Other things being equal, it is wrong to devote resources to future generations rather than to current generations. One response to this would be to dispute premise (2) and to challenge whether this would be the case even if there is dangerous climate change. Alternatively, one might query the certitude with which this argument pronounces that future generations will definitely be wealthier. Can we be that sure? Such confidence certainly seems unwarranted at the moment. Isn't there a risk that a global recession might leave some future generations worse off than the current one? If so, how does that affect the argument?31 I want, however, to focus on premise (1) and to argue that (1) relies on an implausible principle of intergenerational justice. Why would it be wrong to devote resources to future generations if they are wealthier than current generations? A. Three reasons suggest themselves. First, of course, many welfare economists who subscribe to (1) will appeal to the principle of diminishing marginal utility.32 That is to say, they will start with a commitment to utilitarianism and then add that the marginal utility of each extra unit of wealth decreases the wealthier a person is. It follows from these two assumptions that, if future generations will be wealthier than current generations, then it is wrong to devote resources to future generations. Therefore, current generations can discount the resources to be devoted to future generations. However, this argument is vulnerable to an obvious objection, namely that it fails to disaggregate within generations and hence tolerates outcomes in which some lead appalling lives.33 It succeeds only if we consider each future generation as an aggregate and if we do not distinguish, for example, between the future Africans and future Americans who are members of the same generation. Thus even if a future generation at t2 is very wealthy and much wealthier than the generation alive at t1 that can hide the fact that some are very badly off at t2 (and indeed are worse off than some of the poorest at t1). Once disaggregated in this way, the case for devoting resources to the present (which in this context means not pursuing mitigation on behalf of future generations) diminishes because by doing so we will be bringing into existence a state of affairs in the future in which some, perhaps many, are needlessly unable to enjoy the fundamental rights specified by the Rights Principle. There are, however, more sophisticated arguments for (1) which avoid this problem. Consider, for example, the following two arguments: The Ability to Pay Argument: This holds that justice requires that those with the most ability to pay should bear the burden of combating social ills. It follows from this that if future generations are wealthier then they should foot the bill for combating climate change. In virtue of their wealth, they can bear the burden more easily than current generations. The Cost-Effectiveness Argument: This holds that we should distribute resources in the most cost-effective manner. If future generations are wealthier then they have a greater ability to save lives than do current generations. Therefore, they, rather than current generations, should pay because by doing so they can achieve more good.34 These arguments are subtly different. The Cost-Effectiveness Argument is concerned with the number of lives saved and says that deferring the effort to combat climate change to later generations would be desirable because by doing so we can save more lives. The Ability to Pay Argument, by contrast, is not committed to the claim that deferring the effort until later saves more lives. It claims that it is fairer to any would-be duty-bearers to postpone efforts till later.35 Its focus is on the putative duty-bearers (it is wrong to burden X if Y is wealthier); whereas the focus of the Cost-Effectiveness Argument is on the recipients of any program designed to combat climate change, and more generally secure people's rights (it is wrong for humanity to try to help group (A) now when humanity could help group (A+100) later). Both the Ability to Pay Argument and the Cost-Effectiveness Argument are better arguments than the preceding utilitarian one because, unlike it, they are not necessarily indifferent to the protection of human rights, including those rights specified by the Rights Principle. Proponents of both can be concerned with ensuring that everyone has a guaranteed decent standard of living. Both are nonetheless unconvincing. B. Consider first the Ability to Pay Principle Argument. This encounters several problems. First, as I have argued at greater length elsewhere, the problem with relying on this principle to attribute responsibilities is simply that it conflicts with a very deep conviction that polluters should generally pay for their acts of pollution.36 If, for example, I leave rubbish in the street then, ceteris paribus, I have primary responsibility to clear it up—not some other actor who happens to have more wealth than me. Similarly, if my firm releases toxic waste into a river thereby harming others, we have a strong conviction that my firm should be held accountable for this—and not another firm that is wealthier. The view that the polluter should pay is one that is deeply rooted in our moral convictions and it follows from the principle that agents should be held responsible for their ends. Suppose, though, that we accord some role to the Ability to Pay Principle, a second complication with the argument is that accepting the Ability to Pay Principle does not entail that we should allocate all of the burden associated with this role to future generations. Even if future people are, as an aggregate, wealthier than the current generation, there are, no doubt, some who are currently alive who are much wealthier than many future people will be. So an Ability to Pay Principle would require them to bear a burden in proportion to their wealth. Rather than allocate all responsibilities to future generations, it would endorse a scheme in which some wealthy current people pay and some poor future people do not. (Note, of course, that this second response cannot show that all growth discounting is impermissible. It simply establishes that the responsibility cannot be attributed entirely to future generations—but, for all that it says, it is compatible with thinking that some of it should be borne by contemporaries. As such, it is compatible with the current generation attributing some priority to [some] contemporaries.) There are, however, deeper problems with the Ability to Pay Argument. That many future people will be wealthier than many of those who are currently alive does not entail postponing the effort to combat climate change later for two further reasons. First, obviously the cost of tackling the problem may—indeed almost certainly, will—increase and might increase by more than the increase in wealth. It is a nonsequitur to affirm that since a generation at t2 is wealthier than a generation at t1, it follows that the t2 generation should address the problem. Furthermore, the economic evidence strongly suggests that the rate of growth of the cost will exceed the rate of growth of global GDP. The appeal of an Ability to Pay Principle is that by allocating the tasks to the most advantaged it both enables a task to be performed and ensures that the duty-bearers are more able to pursue their own ends and goals.

Professor Kolm's books and articles form one of the most important contributions to contemporary social ethics. Even though the main parts of his works were originally published in or have been translated into English, they have not received the attention they deserve. This is sufficient reason to highly recommend his Modern Theories of Justice, which contains a detailed introduction to his other books. Since the late fifties, Professor Kolm has developed a general theory of justice. He has also extensively contributed to the critical evaluation of the various theories, principles, or criteria of justice that influence economists. Professor Kolm presents his theory of justice as resulting from an application of rationality (in the sense of rational justification) to the question of global justice (what should be done in society?), that is, to the definition of the social optimum and of what is right or good in society. Briefly, this social optimum basically consists of first satisfying basic needs and guaranteeing basic rights and second allocating society's resources (including human resources) in an equitable way. The latter principle requires mixing the (somehow competing) moral criteria of equal process freedom (freedom to benefit from the results of one's acts), equal consumption, and equal satisfaction. Process freedom alone justifies free markets and no resource redistribution. Equal consumption, when combined with efficiency, requires superequity (that is, no agent would strictly prefer any convex combination of the allocations received by others to his own allocation). Equal satisfaction requires to leximin welfare levels corresponding to fundamental preferences, a (difficult) concept that allows the social observer, in particularly unjust or unequal situations, to unambiguously identify the worst-off agents, that is, the agents who should be allocated more resources. Among the different ways of mixing process freedom and equal consumption, Professor Kolm elaborated a particularly interesting intermediary case in recent contributions (recall that the whole structure of his theory, including the ideas of the maximin in fundamental preferences, income justice and superequity, unjust inequality measurement, etc., was first developed and presented in the late sixties). The purpose of this intermediary case is to equally share the benefits of possibly unequal productive capacities while letting agents individually benefit from their own consumptive capacities. The solution consists of a fixed-duration income equalization. This criterion is met when all agents in a society face a budget set having the property that by choosing a prespecified labor time (the so-called fixed duration) any agent would earn the same labor income. Professor Kolm's theory of justice also considers several reasons why the first-best social optimum could not be reached (for example, market failures) and proposes solutions to these problems (for example, social contracts, which give foundations to a theory of the state). Finally, a large part of the book is devoted to a critical appraisal of the main ethical theories influencing the development of normative economics (what justifies the title of the book), with a long discussion on utilitarianism and social choice theory. The general picture is quite impressive. Professor Kolm is not only able to discuss a long and diversified series of topics, such as the economics of poverty, the no self in Buddhism or the ideology of the French Revolution, but he also succeeds in building links among all these topics and integrating them into a unified theory. …",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Time preference,238

On the one hand, a progressive tax system can counteract inequality in initial conditions and substitute for imperfect private insurance against idiosyncratic earnings risk. On the other hand, progressivity reduces incentives to work and to invest in skills, distortions that are especially costly when the government must finance public goods. We develop a tractable equilibrium model that features all of these trade-offs. The analytical expressions we derive for social welfare deliver a transparent understanding of how preference, technology, and market structure parameters influence the optimal degree of progressivity. A calibration for the U.S. economy indicates that endogenous skill investment, flexible labor supply, and the desire to finance government purchases play quantitatively similar roles in limiting optimal progressivity.

10.2139/ssrn.1720983,Risk Preferences Under Extreme Poverty: A Field Experiment,,"Until now, the dominant belief concerning the relationship between poverty and risk aversion is that the poor are more risk averse. If the poor are more risk averse, then they will choose “low risk-low return” activities that trap them in poverty. However, both empirical and experimental evidence show no clear pattern such as would suggest that the poor are somehow more averse to risk than others; at times, they even seem to embrace risk, while at other times, there seems to be no difference. Focus has tended to be on extreme behaviors, as these are related to sub-optimal decisions such as have even raised questions whether an individual can be simultaneously both poor and rational. Amongst all the available empirical evidence, there is one bit of evidence of special interest - changes in behavior whenever subsistence is at risk. This paper emerges from the fact that recent experimental evidence in both psychology and economics suggests that certain decisions made under risk respond to reference points. We develop a theory within the traditional stream of rational choices, whereby the references are set by only observable variables, such as prices and family size. According to this theory, extremely poor individuals respond to the income reference that guarantees the consumption of the necessary calories so as to ensure a healthy and longer life. Being in the neighborhood of this reference can incentivize both the seeking of high risk, whenever below the reference, and an aversion to high risk, when above. An experimental exercise was conducted involving 92 individuals from households living in poverty and extreme poverty wherein they participated in a baseline risk experiment that was the one we analyzed. Inasmuch as the treatment was not randomly assigned, but instead was determined based on households’ per-capita incomes, a quasi-experimental approach was used to analyze the results. We use a regression discontinuity design, and find evidence suggesting that being presented with the opportunity of avoiding undernourishment significantly decreases a household’s risk aversion.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Risk preference,4
10.1504/ijhd.2017.087937,"Poverty, happiness, and risk preferences in rural Ethiopia",,This paper examines the relationship between risk preferences and self-reported assessments of happiness in life for a sample of peasants from 15 different sites in rural Ethiopia. The relationships were estimated using ordered probit models and the results show that happier subjects were more likely to choose risky alternatives in both real and hypothetical experimental games. The correlation between happiness and willingness to take risk remains positive even when endogeneity of happiness is accounted for using the instrumental variables' estimation technique. The empirical results seem to be consistent with the hypothesis that innate optimism and the resulting overestimation of the probabilities of favourable outcomes by the subjects is the dominant force driving the correlation between happiness and risk preferences. This implies that creating an environment where optimism can flourish may not only help improve social wellbeing but may also encourage entrepreneurial endeavours.,Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Risk preference,2
10.1111/1468-246x.00061,The World Bank Approach to Pension Reform,,"This paper highlights the World Bank’s thinking and worldwide involvement in pension reform. Both are driven by the Bank’s mandate to help countries develop economically and to reduce poverty. The Bank has four key concerns in working with clients on pension policy: (1) short‐term financing and long‐term financial viability; (2) effects on economic growth; (3) adequacy and other distributive issues; and (4) political risk and sustainability. In response to these concerns and after review of the three main reform options for unfunded systems ‐ mere PAYG reform, a rapid and complete shift to a mandatory funded system, and a gradual shift to a multipillar scheme ‐ the Bank clearly favours the multipillar approach but in a pragmatic and country‐specific manner. When helping to implement a pension reform the Bank fully takes account of country preferences and circumstances, bases its support on sound reform criteria, links the client assistance with knowledge management, provides training and other measures to enhance the reform capacity of a country, and seeks cooperation with other international institutions. In addition, the Bank has a comprehensive research agenda to improve the working of multipillar schemes, and the investigations include issues of coverage, administrative costs and annuities.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Risk preference,181
10.1111/j.1467-9353.2007.00356.x,"Session Discussion: Dynamic Risk Preferences, Poverty Traps, and Thresholds",,"These papers constitute a renewed search for an alternative to what Just and Michelson describe as the classic utility function-a concave function of current wealth plus contemporaneous income. The motivation for this search can be viewed as a response to Matthew Rabin's demonstration that uniform concavity has incredible implications for behavior (e.g., Rabin and Thaler). The remedy Just and Michelson seek is (explicitly or implicitly) an indirect utility function in first-period income, albeit with both concave and convex segments, such that the decision-maker can be risk-averse or risk-loving, depending on the range of outcomes for the decision in question. A unifying theme of the session is that nonconvexities in transaction costs and asset returns, especially capital-stock thresholds, induce the appearance of risk preferences without the contrivance of exogenous risk preferences in first-period income. Buschena and Zilberman assume that the prototypical decision maker has different concave utility functions for different status levels. Assuming that the probability distribution of being in various status groups is a function of income in the current period, one can readily derive indirect utility functions of current-period income. For the two-status case, this results in a Friedman-Savage (FS) shaped indirect utility function. This helps underscore the presumption of both concave and convex segments, albeit by assuming the existence of classic utility functions in the first place. The intuition of the convex section in the middle of the FS function is clear enough; it stems from the prospect of a discontinuous jump to the high-status utility function. But one wonders why the function should be concave at very low incomes. Indeed, Lybbert and Barrett discuss the illustrative case of two thresholds-one at subsistence income and a Micawber threshold",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Risk preference,1

One assumption underlying the O-RDindex is that respondents can distinguish between what that they cannot afford and what they do not want. This assumption contradicts the subjective usage of the concept relative deprivation (S-RD), which suggests a connection between economic circumstances, choice of reference group and consumption preferences. The present analysis supports the S-RD assumptions. People with limited access to economic resources are more likely to say they ‘do not want’ various consumable items. The results indicate a subjective bias that leads to underestimation of the incidence of O-RD among those suffering from the greatest economic hardship. However, it is also concluded that asking people to differentiate between choice and economic constraint improves our measurement of O-RD and decreases the risk that relatively well-off individuals will score high on the O-RDindex due to peculiar prioritising of consumption. Yet it is still the case that the social mechanisms related to S-RD most probably lead to underestimation of O-RD.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Risk preference,100

Mechanisms by which poverty affects development, however, remain unclear. To explore one potential mechanism of poverty's impact on social-emotional and cognitive development, an experimental examination of a rodent model of scarcity-adversity was conducted and compared to results from a longitudinal study of human infants and families followed from birth (N = 1,292) who faced high levels of poverty-related scarcity-adversity. Cross-species results supported the hypothesis that altered caregiving is one pathway by which poverty adversely impacts development. Rodent mothers assigned to the scarcity-adversity condition exhibited decreased sensitive parenting and increased negative parenting relative to mothers assigned to the control condition. Furthermore, scarcity-adversity reared pups exhibited decreased developmental competence as indicated by disrupted nipple attachment, distress vocalization when in physical contact with an anesthetized mother, and reduced preference for maternal odor with corresponding changes in brain activation. Human results indicated that scarcity-adversity was inversely correlated with sensitive parenting and positively correlated with negative parenting, and that parenting fully mediated the association of poverty-related risk with infant indicators of developmental competence. Findings are discussed from the perspective of the usefulness of bidirectional-translational research to inform interventions for at-risk families.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Risk preference,57

A multilevel analysis extends existing research by examining, for both men and women and across 24 European countries, the effect of the preferred sex-composition of offspring on whether parents have or intend to have a third child. Using the European Social Survey (2004/5), a multilevel (random coefficient) ordered logit regression of that intention (N=3,323) and a binary logistic multilevel model of the transition to a third child (N=6,502) demonstrate the presence of a mixed-sex preference. In countries with a high risk of poverty in old age, a preference for sons is found, particularly for men.

10.2489/jswc.66.2.87,Risk preferences as determinants of soil conservation decisions in Ethiopia,,"Soil degradation is one of the most serious environmental problems in the highlands of Ethiopia. The prevalence of traditional agricultural land use and the absence of appropriate resource management often result in the degradation of natural soil fertility. This has important implications for soil productivity, household food security, and poverty. Given the extreme vulnerability of farmers in this area, we hypothesized that farmers9 risk preferences might affect the sustainability of resource use. This study presents experimental results on the willingness of farmers to take risks and relates the subjective risk preferences to actual soil conservation decisions. The study looked at a random sample of 143 households with 597 farming plots. We found that a high degree of risk aversion significantly decreases the probability of adopting soil conservation. This implies that reducing farmers9 risk exposure could promote soil conservation practices and thus more sustainable natural resource management. This might be achieved by improving tenure security, promoting access to extension services and education, and developing income-generating off-farm activities.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Risk preference,55

The analyses are related to theoretical assumptions about adaptation of preferences, risk exposure, and welfare-state attitudes. It is shown that adaptation of preference increases the ""evaluation gap"" between the two measures. Risk exposure generally does not lead to a more generous evaluation of the poverty line or to a narrower evaluation gap. Positive sentiments toward redistribution are connected with a generous assessment of the poverty line and a small evaluation gap. Those who believe that welfare benefits are misused have a restrictive view of both the poverty line and the minimum income they can accept for themselves.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Risk preference,27

This paper argues and attributes the low level of technology adoption and impact to the discrepancy between the farmers' needs and the attributes of technologies generated. The empirical evidences have been generated based on the analyses of coffee farmers' variety attribute preferences, taking coffee seedlings as production technologies. Attribute preferences of smallholder farmers are governed by their contextual household characteristics, institutional, and socioeconomic factors. According to the results, risk vulnerable farmers prefer seeds adaptable to their local conditions and varieties with stable yield attribute. On the contrary, farmers in more accessible areas and/or those who are less concerned in securing subsistence income levels opt for income maximizing attributes, namely, yield and marketability. The study results have also shown the mechanisms of how farmers' attribute preferences change with development‐oriented interventions. The paper demonstrates why and how policy‐makers should formulate context specific technology development and agricultural extension strategies.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Risk preference,56

This essay will present and discuss the prevalence of HIV among young women in South Africa and the reasons for such a high prevalence in the country.

However, multiple equilibria may also foster risk-taking behavior by some poor people. We illustrate this idea with a simple analytical model in which people with different wealth and ability endowments make investment and risky activity choices in the presence of known nonconvex asset dynamics. This model underscores a crucial distinction between familiar static concepts of risk aversion and forward-looking dynamic risk responses to nonconvex asset dynamics. Even when unobservable preferences exhibit decreasing absolute risk aversion, observed behavior may suggest that risk aversion actually increases with wealth near perceived dynamic asset thresholds. Although high ability individuals are not immune from poverty traps, they can leverage their capital endowments more effectively than lower ability types and are therefore less likely to take seemingly excessive risks. In general, linkages between behavioral responses and wealth dynamics often seem to run in both directions. Both theoretical and empirical poverty trap research could benefit from making this two-way linkage more explicit.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Risk preference,35

New York : UNDP , 2007 . xvi + 384 pp. $29.95 paperback. The pdf of this document can be downloaded at : http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/global/hdr2007-2008/ Climate change is one of the so-called 'global environmental problems'— like water scarcity and biodiversity loss. In 1992 the UN member states established a Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system. A significant number of these countries subsequently developed the Kyoto Protocol to curb climate change. Secretary General of the UN Ban Ki-Moon has dubbed climate change 'a defining issue of our era'. The wide realization that it is, is one key precondition for a new global compact to succeed the current inadequate Kyoto Protocol which will come to an end in 2012. That new compact is rather slow in coming about, for all kinds of reasons — not least amongst these: vested interests and asymmetries in responsibilities for having caused the problem and in suffering the consequences. At the end of 2007 the latest conference of the parties to UNFCCC met in Bali and agreed on a plan to try and arrive at a multilateral agreement in 2009. Prior to the Bali conference UNDP issued its Human Development Report: Fighting Climate Change: Human Solidarity in a Divided World (UNDP, 2007). For its factual basis for assessing the prospects of climate change and its impacts, the UNDP report leans heavily on recent reports on climate change by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2007a, 2007b, 2007c). IPCC is a worldwide organization of scientists set up by the World Meteorological Organization and the UN Environmental Programme to periodically assess the state of knowledge about climate change, its causes and its impacts. It operates independently, albeit there has always been discussion about the way the IPCC process allows for influence by governments in the manner in which the Summary Reports (not the underlying technical reports) are phrased. UNDP, like many other international organizations (governmental and non-governmental), used the more technical reports to add its own elaborations of how to address the climate challenge in a development perspective. Climate change is a set of changes in climatic conditions globally — particularly 'global warming'— arising from changes in the concentrations of a number of gases in the atmosphere due to emissions of 'greenhouse gases'. The emissions of greenhouse gases are embedded in human activities — thus, they reflect development pathways. These gases originate from fossil fuel combustion (about 70 per cent) and form changes in land use (IPCC, 2007a). Climate change gives rise to impacts on both natural and social systems: changes in rainfall patterns affecting agricultural productivity and giving rise to droughts or floods; human health effects; sea level rise affecting people living in coastal zones; etc. As vulnerabilities in developing countries are relatively high, since they have less adaptive capacities or 'resilience', climate change will deepen poverty, through the loss of life, livelihoods, assets, infrastructure, and by affecting the sectoral origins of growth, the ability of the poor to engage in the non-farm sector, and by increasing inequality. If development is about the expansion of choice and freedoms (capabilities) that enable people to live lives that they value (Sen in UNDP, 2007: 28–9), and to the extent that these freedoms depend on the quality of the environment and on climatic conditions in particular, then climate change is a developmental issue. I believe it is therefore only appropriate that this aspect of climate change gets recognition, not only analytically but also in the post-Bali negotiations. Most certainly the UNDP report has added substantively to these negotiations. Global warming is currently still below 1°C (against the pre-industrial level), but may rise to 5–7°C toward the end of this century, unless action takes place. IPCC work as well as reviews by others (Stern, 2006) suggests there are thresholds at around 2°C and 3°C beyond which effects accelerate and/or new ones will become manifest. Beyond 2°C serious melting of Antarctic icecaps may add very significantly to sea level rise, and oceanic cold/warm water circulation patterns may be radically altered with profound additional climatic consequences. Basically, the UNDP Human Development Report adopts the above view on climate change and its impacts (see pp. 21–3); in some respects it is more concerned than the IPCC reports, for example, when it comes to the triggering of 'catastrophic impacts' (pp. 35–7) such as the icecap melting. In view of these and other risks UNDP opts for the 2°C cap on global warming, which, in the international policy discussion is a quite significant choice, given the implied demands on necessary societal action towards 'decarbonization' of the global economy. I admit to having no problem with this choice (Banuri and Opschoor, 2007). Responses to climate change may affect social activities, and thus also emission levels; here too developmental features are obvious. Societies exposed to climate change and its impacts may react to it by: (i) just absorbing it (absence of response action) and the damage it causes; (ii) adapting to it, thus reducing adverse consequences; and (iii) doing something about the causes of climate change, such as reducing emissions (or 'mitigation') (IPCC, 2007b, 2007c). The UNDP report relates climate change and trends therein to development and to driving forces behind climate change (Chapter 1). Several scenarios of possible development pathways are introduced, including a 'sustainable emissions development pathway'. Chapter 2 looks at climate change-related shocks and the unequal vulnerabilities to these in agricultural production and food security, water stress and scarcity, sea level rise and extreme weather events, human health, and biodiversity. The third chapter is about avoiding dangerous climate change. Technically, there is a 'mitigation potential' to bring concentrations down to levels compatible with reducing warming to less than 2°C. The chapter deals with ways to realize these objectives (for example, carbon pricing, regulation and international co-operation). The final chapter presents the need for adaptation and discusses options for meeting this. In the course of this discussion, UNDP distils an 'agenda for action' that sketches strategies both for mitigation and adaptation, to which I will return below. I will first look at some of the analytical features of the report. Even though some impacts of climate change are already felt, most of the misery predicted will occur in future. Moreover, we are not sure (yet) about these impacts. So why would the world care and why would or should UNDP? UNDP's answer is that climate change confronts the world with 'the threat of a twin catastrophe': (i) an immediate threat to human development (for example, through the enhanced risk of not achieving development goals); and (ii) the threats to future generations. Climate change will undercut efforts to curb poverty and enhance human development and will hamper the sustained realization of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Lack of action in response to this threat would lead to costs or sacrifices that are likely to be very high, especially in developing contexts. Regarding future generations, humanity '…is living beyond its environmental means and running up ecological debts that future generations will be unable to repay' (UNDP, 2007: 21–3). Future generations will 'see our response to climate change as a measure of our ethical values' (ibid.). In this analysis one may recognize two types of arguments: ethical and economic ones. UNDP elaborates these as follows. In a '…one-country world inhabited by citizens who share a concern for the well-being of future generations, climate change mitigation would be an urgent priority' as an insurance strategy against huge risks (ibid., p. 39).This is a more or less 'holistic' approach based on enlightened collective (self-) interest labelled 'climate stewardship' and that position relates to elements such as irreversibility and inertia, publicness and interdependence, uncertainty and catastrophe, etc. (ibid., pp. 58–60). One is reminded of notions such as 'only one Earth' (Ward and Dubos, 1972), on which 'we' have a 'common future' (WCED, 1987). Indeed, the Earth's atmosphere is a global public good. In much of the analysis on climate politics, this translates into applying simplistic social analysis by looking at society as a single entity, reflecting and deciding on climate change and what to do about it. As a first approximation, that may be all right, as long as it is followed by more sophisticated analysis, which UNDP does provide. But, still on the holistic track, one should, I feel, be concerned with the stewardship metaphor. A stewardship position is as strong as the priority given to concerns over climate conditions for future generations. That priority might evaporate, the more optimistic the present generation is about its descendants' economic and technical potentials. Why bother about our great grandchildren if they will have significantly more means than 'us' to mitigate (and/or adapt)? That is why I qualify this position as one of 'weak climate stewardship'. A similar weakening might be the result of predominantly less risk aversive attitudes. In a more robust approach —'strong climate stewardship' I would call it — the irreversibility of large scale climate change is recognized to invoke the need to apply the Precautionary Principle (one of the Rio principles of sustainable development, mentioned only in passing by UNDP (see, for example, UNDP, 2007: 63). That principle asks for action in cases of large scale environmental change despite scientific uncertainty. The status of the principle is not unambiguous. UNDP could and should (in my view) have gone further to promulgate it as one of the foundations of sound and solidarity-based global climate mitigation policies. In an economic perspective the answer to the question of how much mitigation to undertake in the short run would depend on how costs and benefits are distributed over time and how future costs and benefits are weighted. The Stern Review of economic aspects of climate change (Stern, 2006) addresses the question by applying cost–benefit logic based on models of future effects on economic welfare looking ahead almost 200 (sic) years. Going far beyond mere income effects, re-weighing benefits and costs to correct for inequalities in economic welfare, and applying very low discount rates to avoid allowing time preference to diminish future effects, Stern concludes that the GDP-equivalents of welfare costs due to global warming if no action is taken would be five to twenty times as high as the costs of undertaking mitigative action (to stay within a 3°C boundary). So, mitigation would not only be morally preferable but also economically desirable. Critics of the review have argued that the choice of discount rate was arbitrary and did not match real and prevalent time preference. Putting higher rates into the model would seriously undermine the conclusion of Stern, and suggest much lower and less immediate mitigative action. More fundamental critiques (not reviewed by UNDP), such as Spash (2007), state that cost–benefit analysis cannot nor should be applied on technical grounds (and there is some methodological truth in that). Core elements in Spash's critique are that Stern et al. embrace the notion that economic growth is essential for welfare growth, that he deploys a utilitarian approach, and uses methods only applicable in case of reversibility and in settings of partial change. Even with methodological and ethical caveats, I feel it is worthwhile to know the results of cost–benefit approaches to these questions, since so many interest groups and decision makers (big and small) on climate, energy and land use, do take an interest in them. In a not unreasonable analysis, the welfare costs of inaction vis-à-vis climate change may by far outweigh the costs of action. Yet, whatever one feels about this, a more convincing economic argument might be that of mitigation as a risk insurance (as put forward by UNDP). But it is time we return – with UNDP – from these journeys into the future to the real world of today. That world is not a unified one, with a homogeneous 'we' thinking about whether or not to take future-oriented action. It is a politically fragmented world characterized by social and economic inequalities in access to resources, exposure to environmental degradation, opportunity and capability — a world in which decisions reflect the hegemony of the living rich rather than ethically balancing the interests of all. The previous subsection began by asking why the world should care about climate change. One entry back into the real world is to ask: does the world care, or rather: do economic and political agents care about climate change? Does the world care? In 1992 it formulated the UNFCCC with the ambitious goal to achieve stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, within a time frame sufficient to enable, among others, 'economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner' (United Nations, 1994: 4). This was elaborated in and by the Kyoto Protocol that was, for the developed countries, to lead to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of some 5 per cent in 2012 (against 1990 emissions). As UNDP 2007 states, delivery has been disappointing; there was insufficient ambition and an insufficient sense of urgency. The issue of the seriousness of the climate problem now basically settled thanks to IPCC, the questions are: what should be done, who should do what, and how should the burdens of that (including financial responsibility) be distributed. Technologically climate change mitigation can be undertaken at least to stay within the 3°C boundary (Stern, 2006). With additional effort, the 2°C boundary might be attainable as well (IPCC, 2007c). Investment figures quoted amount to 1–2 per cent of global income by about 2030 (UNDP gives a 1.6 per cent average to 2030). Mitigation will have global benefits but in the first instance the costs of it will be borne domestically. Obviously, large scale mitigation has to be undertaken in the industrialized part of the world — the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Central and Eastern European countries. Increasingly it has become clear that — if only to ensure that it will be effective — mitigation is also to be done on a large scale in the emerging energy consuming economies (China, India, Brazil, etc) and in countries where land use change contributes heavily to climate change (for example, Indonesia). Historically, many developing countries (including some of the larger emerging economies) are hardly responsible. Yet, they are faced with a dwindling atmospheric 'carbon space' and are pressurized to engage in mitigation. If, in the wake of Bali the world would begin to care, who then should pay? Unless developing countries see large direct benefits of mitigation, they will need assistance (technological and financial) if they are to engage in mitigation. Moreover — and, more urgently in the short run in many developing countries, including the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and especially Small Island Developing States — there is an adaptation bill to be settled. Most of the countries in the developing world have not, or hardly, contributed to the current concentrations of greenhouse gases, and yet they bear (more than on average) the consequences of climate change. No matter what mitigation will happen in the next ten to twenty years, these damage and adaptation costs will rise in the decades ahead. If they were not responsible for the problems they now suffer from, who should bear the costs of adaptation? 'Should' questions are moral and political ones. Basically, I believe, there are two ways of elaborating fair or just arrangements for burden sharing: those of deontological and those of consequential justice. In the first approach, the central tenet is that individuals have the right to not have to suffer the adverse consequences of actions by others. The Polluter Pays Principle of OECD (it indeed is a regionally accepted principle, not a globally endorsed one) is an expression of this view. The responsible party is the one to bear the consequences, and pay. The Rio Principle that says states have the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or areas, comes close to providing a 'no harm' basis for liability. In the second approach the key consideration is the fairness of the outcomes. In this perspective, those who can best bear the costs should accept taking a greater share in them. In the Kyoto Protocol the attention is focused on mitigation, and responsibility is put on the plates of rich, industrialized economies. Adaptation is hardly considered, which means that the costs of it so far have largely devolved to those who are exposed to climate change impacts. The present systems are far from complete in terms of coverage, and are unclear about liability. The global community has at its disposal another Rio Principle: that of Common but Differentiated Responsibilities. There may be a common responsibility — especially to the poor today whose livelihoods are threatened and who have a right to positive human development and to future generations. These responsibilities are not equal as: (i) the burdens of sharing responsibilities should end up on the shoulders of those that are strongest or richest, and (ii) because the causation of the problem points at a responsibility to facilitate and fund appropriate action that ends up with the industrialized counties more than with, for instance, the low income countries. So, some as yet unelaborated mix of both approaches is to be applied, if the principles hold. Again, it would have been useful if the UNDP report had been clearer about firming up the status of such principles — given that it does recognize the appropriateness of an ethics-grounded approach. UNDP translates its target on warming into a reduction of emissions to be achieved (50 per cent by 2050), which is then developed into an action plan on mitigation. As temperatures would still rise and trigger or accelerate the nastiness (and perhaps the catastrophes) until 2050, UNDP also develops a plan on adaptation. I will review these two dimensions separately. On mitigation, UNDP sets up an emissions pathway to achieve its global 50 per cent emissions reduction: 80 per cent in or by developed countries and 20 per cent in or by developing countries. Beyond 2050 the economies of the world would have to 'de-carbonize' almost completely (UNDP, 2007: 48–9). In this scenario emissions would start having an impact on temperatures after 2030 (temperature peaking only around 2050). Key instruments or steps to achieve these emissions reductions are: (i) carbon pricing (taxation and/or 'cap-and-trade' programmes driving up carbon prices from US$ 10–20/ton in 2010 to US$ 60–100 in 2050); (ii) less fossil fuel dependent energy policies (for example, 20 per cent renewables in energy use by 2020); (iii) energy sector reforms in developing countries, enabled by a Climate Change Mitigation Facility of US$ 25–50 billion per annum (roughly 1 per cent of OECD GDP). I will comment on some elements of these. A first point to observe is on the distribution of emissions reductions. The 50 per cent reduction can be arrived at in various ways. The EU proposes a 60–80 per cent cut in the North and if we assume this will become 70 per cent, this would amount to the requirement of a 30 per cent cut in emissions in developing countries. This is somewhat more than the 20 per cent UNDP arrives at, but UNDP assumes an 80 per cent cut in the North. NGOs calculate that a reduction of 30 per cent in the South on a per capita basis and a doubling of the population there from 1990 to 2050 would mean an effective reduction of 60 per cent (TWN, 2007; in fact, the figure quoted here is 65 per cent). That would be a tremendous challenge. So, the picture in terms of reductions distribution is somewhat gloomier than presented by UNDP — and very much depends on the way the carbon-space is to be shared by the different economic regions of the world. A second point is to do with the mix of policy instruments proposed, especially on the role of markets versus governments. Under the Kyoto Protocol, several so-called 'flexible mechanisms' were developed that effectively entailed carbon pricing through market mechanisms. One was emissions trading; another one was the so-called 'Clean Development Mechanism' (CDM). The realities of the use of these instruments have shown some very serious shortcomings due perhaps in part to the way they have been shaped (such as with trading, well discussed in UNDP 2007: 129ff.), but also in part due to the very nature of market-based (or market-oriented) instruments — they tend to be susceptible to market failure (for critiques on both levels, see the special issue of Development Dialogue devoted to carbon trading in Lohman, 2006). The suggestion in Development Dialogue was (in short) to complement, if not replace, such instruments with/by instruments of public sector regulation and intervention. This could take the form of standard setting, emission level control ('capping'), land use policies, publicly undertaken and/or sponsored R&D activities, etc. It is good (as well as academically correct) to see UNDP stating (on p. 132) that carbon pricing alone will be insufficient. Yet, the analysis remains superficial. So does the discussion on the flaws of CDM. In the development of a post-Kyoto compact UNDP could have made a greater contribution by coming up with more adequate and realistic proposals, for example, on ways to redress the current asymmetries in the way contributions to emissions reductions and to sustainable development are weighed (for more, see WWF, 2007). Another point is that the overall analysis on mitigation is directed primarily towards development at the macro and sometimes sectoral level. There is little recognition of the role of the micro and institutional (in the social science sense of the word) level. This stands in some contrast to a key observation in IPCC (2007c): the importance of links with social and institutional aspects in development as a crucial key towards a more sustainable process of development (including the climate-related aspects of it). IPCC gives ample illustration of how social and institutional aspects play a role in the myriad of decisions at all levels: households; communities; and countries that, in combination, result in a particular development pathway. UNDP has an interesting, though perhaps somewhat anecdotal, chapter on adaptation. Many developing countries are more exposed to climate change impacts, already characterized by poverty-related acute vulnerability. What is required there is the development of adaptive capacity — social and institutional. The chapter is built on the tenet that adaptation requires human development and, conversely, that human development is 'the most secure foundation for adaptation' (UNDP, 2007: 172). Implicit in this diagnosis is that adaptation is context-sensitive, and hence no general strategies or recipes exist. UNDP moves on to discuss national adaptation policies. Pro-poor adaptation policies must merge climate-driven concerns with those of poverty reduction and overcoming inequality. Even though here, too, the emphasis remains on the macro level, the report does underscore that climate change manifests itself in the first instance in the livelihoods of the poor. Empowering people to cope with climate effects is presented as a condition for sustained progress in human development, and this includes social protection policies and practices, the protection of the entitlements of vulnerable people, and the expansion of opportunity (ibid: 178). Adaptation to (intensification of) effects of climate change in most cases boils down to doing better, or more, along the lines that vulnerable communities are operating already (IPCC, 2007b). Enhanced adaptation at the community and regional levels, indeed to a large degree, is more of the same, perhaps in a different gear. UNDP evokes the liability due to historic responsibility for climate change and the principle of protection from harm referred to above. In a divided world we do not have sufficiently strong jurisprudence or legislation to translate that into adequate funding. UNDP puts forward the insurance argument we met above, to justify appeals to the wealthier parts of the international community to raise some US$ 86 billion per annum — new and additional — for climate proofing existing infrastructure, aid, resistance building (capacity development) and disaster recovery, as well as the social empowerment-oriented elements referred to above by 2015 (roughly 0.2 per cent of OECD GDP). Compared with many other policy documents the UNDP report excels because of its choice for stringent targets combined with a clear development orientation. It gives interesting arrays of rationales, combining ethical and more pragmatic (including economic) arguments, such as insurance approaches based on combinations of enlightened self-interest and solidarity. However, it is aimed very much at the players in the international fora where climate change agreements are discussed and constructed: national and international agents. The report refers to development and operates in a development perspective, but does little to bring in a rights-based, or even a principles-based approach. It refers to these things in passing, but apparently it is felt that the players it is aimed at would not be all that thrilled by such radical attempts. In terms of the empirical basis for its proposal, there is much evidence presented in the form of case studies and examples, and there are many results of statistical analysis and modelling/scenario studies. Yet, it does not come close enough to some new insights in the literature, such as the analysis in terms of rich/poor rather than north/south (lifestyle issues, etc.) or approaches in terms of institutions, livelihoods and social dynamics, etc. Nevertheless, the report presents a range of interesting proposals — not only from qualitative and effectiveness points of view, but also in terms of their degree of realism. For mitigation UNDP asks for commitments at the international level involving financial efforts at the US$ 25–50 billion level, and for adaptation about twice as much; together these sums amount to 0.3 per cent of OECD GDP. Even though these are mere ballpark figures, they suggest it would all be doable, provided the international will to act collectively were there.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Risk preference,528

My goal is to demonstrate that certain socio-economic characteristics matter universally for attitude formation, but that their impact varies according to specific welfare state institutions. Analysing poverty risks and the structural position of minimum income protection schemes in the welfare state, I hypothesize that attitudes may be more polarized in generous welfare states than in less generous states. Additionally, I assume that labour market performance may have an influence on attitudes, leading to more sympathetic positions towards state responsibility in times of high unemployment. Using data from Eurobarometer 56.1 (2001) and performing country-wise regressions, I demonstrate that individual socio-economic traits impact on attitudes depending on national contexts. Combining preferences and degrees of polarization shows that attitudes might be formed in the interplay between welfare state and labour market.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Risk preference,54

Ninety-eight separate interviews with women and their husbands conducted in rural Chitwan District, Nepal, over a 12-month period in 1993-94 revealed that people continually and self-consciously weigh the perceived benefits and risks of practicing family planning relative to their situations. Temporary and, especially, hormonal methods are perceived to carry unacceptable health risks. Contraceptive technologies are evaluated in relation to competing priorities and interests. Household poverty heightened the perceived risk of family planning use; poor people fear they can ill afford negative effects to their health that might result. People assess their health status and physical workload, factors that they believe condition their ability to use family planning methods without experiencing damaging health effects. Strategies employed to lower contraceptive risk include altering the method of choice, manipulating relationships with spouses, timing the adoption of contraceptives, managing the context of service provision, and acting in light of the experiences of others.

Without taking its limitations and criticisms too lightly, some economists have been using this measure of self-reported satisfaction as a proxy for utility so as to contribute to a better understanding of individuals' tastes and hopefully behavior. By means of satisfaction questions we can elicit information on individual likes and dislikes over a large set of relevant issues, such as income, working status and job amenities, the risk of becoming unemployed, inflation, and health status. This information can be used to evaluate existing ideas from a new perspective, understand individual behavior, evaluate and design public policies, study poverty and inequality, and develop a preference based valuation method.

10.1111/risa.12976,Variability in Cross‐Domain Risk Perception among Smallholder Farmers in Mali by Gender and Other Demographic and Attitudinal Characteristics,,"Previous research has shown that men and women, on average, have different risk attitudes and may therefore see different value propositions in response to new opportunities. We use data from smallholder farm households in Mali to test whether risk perceptions differ by gender and across domains. We model this potential association across six risks (work injury, extreme weather, community relationships, debt, lack of buyers, and conflict) while controlling for demographic and attitudinal characteristics. Factor analysis highlights extreme weather and conflict as eliciting the most distinct patterns of participant response. Regression analysis for Mali as a whole reveals an association between gender and risk perception, with women expressing more concern except in the extreme weather domain; however, the association with gender is largely absent when models control for geographic region. We also find lower risk perception associated with an individualistic and/or fatalistic worldview, a risk-tolerant outlook, and optimism about the future, while education, better health, a social orientation, self-efficacy, and access to information are generally associated with more frequent worry-with some inconsistency. Income, wealth, and time poverty exhibit complex associations with perception of risk. Understanding whether and how men's and women's risk preferences differ, and identifying other dominant predictors such as geographic region and worldview, could help development organizations to shape risk mitigation interventions to increase the likelihood of adoption, and to avoid inadvertently making certain subpopulations worse off by increasing the potential for negative outcomes.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Risk preference,48
10.1017/s0140525x0999152x,The weirdest people in the world?,,"Abstract Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world's top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers – often implicitly – assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these “standard subjects” are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species – frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior – hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Risk preference,9972

Income uniquely accounted for 3% of the variance in self-efficacy scores, physical health for 10%, mental health for 78% and education for 1%.Given the known links between self-efficacy and workplace productivity, workers who are below the poverty line may be at risk of poor productivity due to the experience of poverty.

Perceived self-efficacy (PSE)—individuals’ perception of their domain-specific capabilities—fundamentally shapes these internal constraints and thereby drives economic behavior. Without sufficient PSE, individuals have little reason to invest greater effort or attempt anything new. Individuals with higher PSE set more ambitious goals, try harder, and persist more diligently. Such proactive engagement in perceiving and creating possibilities is often either ignored or implicitly assumed in simple optimization models. Growing evidence from psychology and economics suggests that PSE deserves greater attention.

People who believe that the causes of poverty lie within the individual (i.e., make an internal attribution) should be supportive of the individual taking responsibility for his or her economic situation as the solution to poverty. In contrast, people who believe that the causes of poverty lie outside the control of the individual (i.e., make an external attribution) should perceive governmental assistance programs as a viable solution to poverty. In addition, it is possible that an individual's level of self-efficacy moderates the relationship between attributions as to the causes of poverty and proposals about solutions to poverty. Data used for this investigation were obtained from the Great Lakes Poll, a large-scale telephone survey of residents in the Midwest of the United States and the province of Ontario, Canada. Statistical analysis of the data via OLS regression found no support for the idea that self-efficacy serves as a moderator. However, support was found for the belief that an individual's attributions towards the causes of poverty are consistent with that person's proposed solutions to poverty. Thus, internal attributions towards causation of poverty predict individual solutions to poverty; conversely, external attributions towards causation predict external solutions for poverty.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and self-efficacy,8

Unfortunately, exposure to multiple poverty‐related risks increases the odds that children will demonstrate increased emotional dysregulation, fewer social skills, less teacher/parent involvement and more conduct problems. Consequently intervention offered to socio‐economically disadvantaged populations that includes a social and emotional school curriculum and trains teachers in effective classroom management skills and in promotion of parent–school involvement would seem to be a strategic strategy for improving young children's school readiness, leading to later academic success and prevention of the development of conduct disorders. Methods: This randomized trial evaluated the Incredible Years (IY) Teacher Classroom Management and Child Social and Emotion curriculum (Dinosaur School) as a universal prevention program for children enrolled in Head Start, kindergarten, or first grade classrooms in schools selected because of high rates of poverty. Trained teachers offered the Dinosaur School curriculum to all their students in bi‐weekly lessons throughout the year. They sent home weekly dinosaur homework to encourage parents’ involvement. Part of the curriculum involved promotion of lesson objectives through the teachers’ continual use of positive classroom management skills focused on building social competence and emotional self‐regulation skills as well as decreasing conduct problems. Matched pairs of schools were randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. Results: Results from multi‐level models on a total of 153 teachers and 1,768 students are presented. Children and teachers were observed in the classrooms by blinded observers at the beginning and the end of the school year. Results indicated that intervention teachers used more positive classroom management strategies and their students showed more social competence and emotional self‐regulation and fewer conduct problems than control teachers and students. Intervention teachers reported more involvement with parents than control teachers. Satisfaction with the program was very high regardless of grade levels. Conclusions: These findings provide support for the efficacy of this universal preventive curriculum for enhancing school protective factors and reducing child and classroom risk factors faced by socio‐economically disadvantaged children.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and self-efficacy,816

However, long-term outcomes after limb reconstruction or amputation have not been fully evaluated.We performed a multicenter, prospective, observational study to determine the functional outcomes of 569 patients with severe leg injuries resulting in reconstruction or amputation. The principal outcome measure was the Sickness Impact Profile, a multidimensional measure of self-reported health status (scores range from 0 to 100; scores for the general population average 2 to 3, and scores greater than 10 represent severe disability). Secondary outcomes included limb status and the presence or absence of major complications resulting in rehospitalization.At two years, there was no significant difference in scores for the Sickness Impact Profile between the amputation and reconstruction groups (12.6 vs. 11.8, P=0.53). After adjustment for the characteristics of the patients and their injuries, patients who underwent amputation had functional outcomes that were similar to those of patients who underwent reconstruction. Predictors of a poorer score for the Sickness Impact Profile included rehospitalization for a major complication, a low educational level, nonwhite race, poverty, lack of private health insurance, poor social-support network, low self-efficacy (the patient's confidence in being able to resume life activities), smoking, and involvement in disability-compensation litigation. Patients who underwent reconstruction were more likely to be rehospitalized than those who underwent amputation (47.6 percent vs. 33.9 percent, P=0.002).

10.2307/353111,"Does Neighborhood and Family Poverty Affect Mothers' Parenting, Mental Health, and Social Support?",,"How neighborhoods affect families living in them has emerged as a key question in understanding the causes and effects of urban poverty. Over the last 20 years people with low incomes have become increasingly likely to live in metropolitan areas and in neighborhoods with a high concentration of low-income people (Jargowsky & Bane, 1990; Jencks & Peterson, 1991; Wacquant & Wilson, 1989; Wilson, 1987). This is particularly true for economically disadvantaged blacks and Hispanics, and for metropolitan areas in the Northeast and Midwest (Jargowsky & Bane, 1990). Some of the ways in which neighborhoods affect individuals have been elucidated in recent literature, although the focus of almost all existing work has been on adolescents and young adults, not on children or parents. Few studies have looked at the processes by which neighborhoods influence families, especially parents, and, in turn, how parents are likely to influence their children. This article addresses the question of how both neighborhood and family conditions might influence the ways in which parents behave. In The Truly Disadvantaged, Wilson (1987) undertook an analysis of the structural changes in postindustrial society that contributed to an increase in the number of poor and jobless people in inner-city neighborhoods. Wilson also has attempted to model linkages between structural changes and the behavior of residents of inner-city, poor neighborhoods. Much of the related work to date has focused on documenting the association between the increased poverty and joblessness in neighborhoods with a decline in jobs (especially jobs not demanding high literacy skills) in central cities (Freeman, 1991; Kasarda, 1990) and with the movement of more highly skilled and advantaged residents out of the inner cities (Wilson, 1987; however, see Massey & Eggers, 1990). Recently, Wilson (1991a, 1991b) has gone beyond structural changes to examine some of the familial and cultural processes that might result from living in neighborhoods with high concentrations of jobless men and family poverty. He suggested that living in neighborhoods in which relatively few individuals hold jobs, few jobs are located within the neighborhood, and single-parent households are prevalent may produce what he terms social isolation; these conditions in turn may produce socialization practices and family life styles that do not reinforce practices associated with steady employment. Postulated characteristics include a focus on the present rather than the future, poor planning and organization, little sense of personal control over events, and a lack of emphasis on school or job-related skills. This constellation of familial conditions might be expressed, and measured, through psychological dimensions such as coping behavior, self-efficacy, problem solving, and present-future orientation, as well as dimensions of family process, such as parenting behavior, organization of the household, and the provision of learning experiences for their children. While this hypothesis has received some attention, it has not been tested directly. Thus, little is known about whether or how neighborhoods may affect maternal characteristics and behaviors. Rather, the primary focus of research has been on how family-level poverty affects parents and children. Research bearing on the effect of family poverty has documented the association between poverty and greater psychological distress and depression (Belle, 1990; Belle, Longfellow, & Makosky, 1982; Danziger & Stern, 1990; McLoyd & Wilson, 1991; Parker, Greer, & Zuckerman, 1988). Poor families have to deal with a greater number of daily stresses which over time weaken their ability to handle subsequent stress (McLoyd, 1990).

However, it is not known whether the experience of poverty can detrimentally impact the self-efficacy feelings of asthma patients. This paper aims to determine whether falling into income or multidimensional poverty lowers self-efficacy among people diagnosed with asthma.Longitudinal analysis of Waves 7 to 11 (2007 to 2011) of the nationally representative Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey using generalized linear models. The analysis was limited to those who had been diagnosed with asthma. The Freedom Poverty Measure was used to identify those in multidimensional poverty.People with asthma who fell into income poverty had significantly lower self-efficacy scores-23% lower (95% CI: -35.1 to -9.1), after falling into income poverty for 3 or 4 years between 2007 and 2011 compared to those who were never in income poverty. Those who fell into multidimensional poverty also had significantly lower self-efficacy scores-25% lower (95% CI: -42.8 to -2.0), after being in multidimensional poverty for 3 or 4 years between 2007 and 2011 compared to those who were never in poverty.Asthmatics who fall into poverty are likely to experience a decline in their feelings of self-efficacy.

In the baseline interview, we employed a qualitative methodology to understand women's experiences of thriving. Women reported a variety of such experiences, the most frequent being enhanced appreciation of life. In the follow‐up study, we created a thriving scale based on responses generated at the initial interview and prior research, then examined which of a number of social/cultural and personal factors predicted thriving 3 years after the initial assessment. Only measures of competence (self‐esteem and self‐ efficacy) and psychological well‐being were related to thriving. Path analyses testing the causal sequence of these variables revealed that negative affect contributed to decreased self‐efficacy and self‐esteem, but it did not have a direct or indirect effect on thriving. Greater self‐esteem positively predicted thriving. In contrast, positive affect did not contribute to either measure of competence, but had a direct effect on thriving.

Accounts of the lived experience of poverty were found to be very similar, despite massive disparities in material circumstances associated with locally defined poverty lines, suggesting that relative notions of poverty are an appropriate basis for international comparisons. Though socially and culturally nuanced, shame was found to be associated with poverty in each location, variably leading to pretence, withdrawal, self-loathing, ‘othering’, despair, depression, thoughts of suicide and generally to reductions in personal efficacy. While internally felt, poverty-related shame was equally imposed by the attitudes and behaviour of those not in poverty, framed by public discourse and influenced by the objectives and implementation of anti-poverty policy. The evidence appears to confirm the negative consequences of shame, implicates it as a factor in increasing the persistence of poverty and suggests important implications for the framing, design and delivery of anti-poverty policies.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and self-efficacy,181

10.2307/353914,Social Capital and Successful Development among At-Risk Youth,,"Social scientists have been slow to appreciate the great diversity among the poor. Until quite recently, researchers have devoted more attention to examining patterns of persistent poverty than to understanding how individuals and families maneuver their way out of economic disadvantage (for exceptions, see Clark, 1983; Kellam, Ensminger, & Turner, 1977; Williams Kornblum, 1985). Evidence about mobility patterns among the poor provides a perfect analogy to the half-empty/half-full glass. Of individuals who begin life in poverty, at least as many manage to improve their circumstances as remain persistently impoverished (Duncan, Hill, & Hoffman, 1988). Yet relatively little is known about how and why some of the disadvantaged eventually escape while others remain entrapped in poverty. As researchers from different disciplines have begun to tackle this problem, they have, not surprisingly, each featured explanations congenial to their distinctive ways of looking at the world. Economists stress the importance of financial and human capital, highlighting how individuals invest time and money to improve their long-term position in the labor force (Palmer, Smeeding, & Torrey, 1988). Psychologists point out the importance of individual traits such as competence and self-efficacy, both of which are linked to upward mobility (Bandura, 1989; Garmezy, 1985; Rutter & Madge, 1976; Werner & Smith, 1982). Sociologists, for their part, underscore the importance of institutional resources and social networks in the communities where poor people reside (Granovetter, 1973; Wellman 8t Wortley, 1990). Of course, in reality these different sorts of mechanisms often operate in tandem. Perhaps the most interesting question, then, is how these various sources of differentiation among the poor are packaged together. Answering the question of how id why certain types of individuals locate and use resources that are often in short supply within their local environments to improve their own prospects, or the long-term prospects of their children, involves integrating the different disciplinary perspectives. This article draws on data from a longitudinal study of teenage mothers and their children to investigate sources of differentiation on several indicators of young adult success. In particular, we explore the role of social capital, a concept developed by Coleman (1988) that to some extent bridges the disciplinary gaps described above. Our goal is to determine whether successful outcomes among our sample of disadvantaged youth are related to measures of both family-based and community-based social capital. SOCIAL CAPITAL AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT The process of investment in the economic, psychological, and social resources believed to be associated with upward mobility begins early in life and typically takes place within the family. Parents, in addition to utilizing their financial resources, cultivate and promote individual competencies in their children; with varying degrees of effectiveness, these same parents seek opportunities in the environment and attempt to shelter their children from dangers. Thus, the family represents a point of common interest to social scientists seeking to understand why and how certain children are able to escape the powerful disadvantage of growing up poor. Coleman (1988) employed the term social capital to designate the complex and variegated social mechanisms that parents garner to advance their children's chances of success. Coleman's description of social capital is quite broad and overlaps with some of the specific theoretical constructs and processes identified by developmental psychologists attempting to explain the successful adaptation of children at risk of long-term disadvantage (see, e.g., Garmezy & Rutter, 1983). Coleman's ideas also echo the approach to studying development formulated by Bronfenbrenner and his students (e.g., Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Garbarino, 1992; Steinberg, Dornbusch, & Brown, 1992). …",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and self-efficacy,689

We conducted in‐depth interviews ( n = 21) to describe parenting experiences and caregivers’ perceptions of their own parenting abilities and to create vignettes for use in directed focus groups. We carried out open focus groups ( n = 2) to gain social perspectives on parenting, and directed focus groups ( n = 2) concentrated on parenting self‐efficacy. Analysis involved memoing and inductive and deductive coding of transcripts. Caregivers’ perceptions of their own parenting were grounded in parenting values such as providing children with basic needs, having well‐behaved children, and having good relationships with children. Caregivers’ perceptions were influenced by challenges, including single parenthood, living with HIV, limited family resources, and mental health problems. When facing challenges, caregivers relied on social support and faith as well as their own parenting confidence. Caregivers’ perceptions of their parenting abilities were influenced by how they felt others perceived them, their satisfaction in the parenting role, their perseverance despite challenges, and the extent to which they had a vision for their family. Our findings contextualize parenting self‐efficacy within parenting values, challenges, and social perceptions among HIV‐affected caregivers in rural Uganda.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and self-efficacy,4

The framework delineates hypotheses for future research, and provides a guide for prevention programs based on the active and direct involvement of participants, particularly communities of color. The framework (1) argues that community involvement moderates the association between three socio-structural risk factors (i.e. poverty, homophobia and racism) and sexual risk behavior; (2) posits that community involvement in HIV/AIDS reduces sexual risk behavior via its effects on four mediating factors (i.e. peer norms, self-efficacy, positive self-identity and alienation); (3) proposes five socio-cultural barriers to and facilitators of community involvement in HIV/AIDS (i.e. motives for participation, poverty, acculturation, stigma and perceived opportunities); and (4) addresses burnout as one potential negative consequence of community involvement in HIV/AIDS-related organizations and groups. The conceptual framework advances the understanding of HIV sexual risk behavior by integrating both its socio-structural risk and protective factors. It contributes to health education by specifying how interventions based on collective action (e.g. community involvement) for social change may be effective in generating healthy behaviors at individual and community levels.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and self-efficacy,159
10.1086/644459,Giving Back Control: Long-Term Poverty and Motivation,,"Traditionally, the poverty policy debate has been dominated on one side by those who focus on restricted opportunity as a cause of persistent poverty and on the other side by those who blame the ""deviant"" attitudes and values of the poor themselves. As the debate has gone historically, any observed difference in attitudes (beliefs in personal efficacy, future orientation, passivity, etc.) has been taken as evidence in favor of the cultural, attitudinal model of the cause of poverty. The policy implications of the cultural models have usually fallen within the conservative social policy agenda. As a result, many have been reluctant to discuss the possible motivational deficits of the persistent poor that limit their ability to achieve self-sufficiency. As is argued here, out of fear of ""blaming the victim,"" we have failed to recognize the full implications of victimization. This article seeks to develop a social-psychological framework for understanding attitudinal deficits produced by constrained opportunities and stigmatizing labels. Applying the psychological theory of control, the article uses the learned helplessness model not only to help understand motivational deficits of the persistent poor but also to point to the therapeutic value of choices in helping to restore the person's sense of control through the welfare system.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and self-efficacy,134

Although observed measures of dyadic conflict were not directly related to women's ratings of self-efficacy, hierarchical regression analysis indicated that mother-toddler conflict served as a moderator.

10.5465/amj.2015.0715,Funding Financial Inclusion: Institutional Logics and the Contextual Contingency of Funding for Microfinance Organizations,,"Microfinance is a promising tool for addressing the grand challenge of global poverty. Yet, while many studies have examined how microfinance loans affect poor borrowers, we know little about how microfinance organizations (MFOs) themselves finance their lending activities. This is a significant oversight because most MFOs do not self-fund their lending, but, rather, rely on loans from external funders. To better understand microfinance funding, we apply and extend the institutional logics perspective to analyze the lending practices of commercial and public funders, who together provide most of the capital for global microfinance. We argue that these funders adhere to financial and development logics, respectively, and that this leads them to invest in different types of MFOs. Yet, in the face of uncertainty, we suggest that the practices motivated by these logics will start to converge in ways that are problematic for a nation's microfinance sector. Using a proprietary database of all traceable loans to MFOs from 2004 to 2012, we find strong support for our hypotheses. In particular, our findings show that the relationship between institutional logics and organizational practices is contextually contingent, and this insight contributes important understanding about the efficacy of microfinance as a poverty-reduction tool.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and self-efficacy,192

10.1353/cye.2009.0000,Poverty and the Psychosocial Competencies of Children: Evidence from the Young Lives Sample in Four Developing Countries,,"Using unique data from four developing countries, this paper explores the relationship between material poverty and the psychosocial competencies of children. Within a cohort of 12-year-olds, we find that measures of self-efficacy, sense of inclusion, self-esteem and educational aspirations all correlate with measures of the material well-being of the family in which they are growing up. In short, material circumstances shape these wider dimensions of child well-being. As other evidence has shown, these measures of psychosocial competencies reflect important life skills that affect children as adults and shape their future socioeconomic status. This suggests a mechanism by which poverty may be transmitted across generations. In addition, our evidence shows how a caregiver's education and school participation affects children's psychosocial competencies. This may indicate a possible means of overcoming such transmission of poverty over time.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and self-efficacy,84
10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.1,Social Cognitive Theory: An Agentic Perspective,,"▪ Abstract The capacity to exercise control over the nature and quality of one's life is the essence of humanness. Human agency is characterized by a number of core features that operate through phenomenal and functional consciousness. These include the temporal extension of agency through intentionality and forethought, self-regulation by self-reactive influence, and self-reflectiveness about one's capabilities, quality of functioning, and the meaning and purpose of one's life pursuits. Personal agency operates within a broad network of sociostructural influences. In these agentic transactions, people are producers as well as products of social systems. Social cognitive theory distinguishes among three modes of agency: direct personal agency, proxy agency that relies on others to act on one's behest to secure desired outcomes, and collective agency exercised through socially coordinative and interdependent effort. Growing transnational embeddedness and interdependence are placing a premium on collective efficacy to exercise control over personal destinies and national life.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and self-efficacy,12591

However, much of this evidence is correlational, and this paper aims to address a call for more research on dynamics. We use rich panel data to evaluate within-individual dynamics in financial management and mental health. We observe increased (decreased) difficulty in managing financial affairs following periods of increased (reduced) psychological distress. Importantly, these dynamics occur in the absence of observable changes to objective financial circumstances (i.e. income and wealth shocks), and are robust with respect to a range of alternative approaches to measurement. Further, we show that most of the association between change in psychological distress and change in financial precariousness (concurrently and subsequently) can be attributed to change in self-efficacy. This supports the idea that investment in mental health will yield important additional benefits via the capacity to empower individuals to make better decisions and escape mental health-based poverty-traps.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and self-efficacy,2

10.2106/00004623-200309000-00006,PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERE LOWER-LIMB INJURY,,"Background: Little is known about the psychological morbidity associated with limb-threatening injuries. It was hypothesized that a substantial proportion of patients who sustain a severe lower-limb injury will report serious psychological distress. Methods: Adult patients who were admitted to one of eight level-I trauma centers for treatment of an injury threatening the lower limb were enrolled during their initial hospitalization. Patients were recontacted at three, six, twelve, and twenty-four months after the injury and asked to complete the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), a fifty-three-item, self-reported measure of psychological distress. Patients who screen positive on the BSI are considered likely to have a psychological disorder and should receive a mental health evaluation. Longitudinal regression techniques were used to model positive case status (i.e., likely to have a psychological disorder) as a function of patient, injury, and treatment characteristics. Results: Of the 569 patients enrolled, 545 (96%) completed at least one BSI and 385 (68%) completed all four. Forty-eight percent of the patients screened positive for a likely psychological disorder at three months after the injury, and this percentage remained high (42%) at twenty-four months. Two years after the injury, almost one-fifth of the patients reported severe phobic anxiety and/or depression. While these two subscales reflected the highest prevalence of severe psychological distress, none of the BSI subscales reflected the prevalence expected from a normal sample (i.e., 2% to 3%). Factors associated with a likely psychological disorder included poorer physical function, younger age, non-white race, poverty, a likely drinking problem, neuroticism, a poor sense of self-efficacy, and limited social support. Relatively few patients reported receiving any mental health services following the injury (12% at three months and 22% at twenty-four months). Conclusions: Severe lower-limb injury is associated with considerable psychological distress. More attention to the psychological as well as the physical health of patients who sustain a limb-threatening injury may be needed to ensure an optimal recovery following these devastating injuries.

Cross-national differences and personality style constructs of external and internal locus of control were used in a MANCOVA design. No significant interaction differences appeared between national status and locus of control, which gave no support to the main hypothesis of this study that respondents from individualistic cultures (South Africa) have internal locus of control and make more individualistic attributions of poverty. Lebanese students were more structuralistic, and had more external than internal locus of control than South Africans. The independent variable of class did not appear as a predictor to the structural attribution for poverty. Hence, university education may be the most important factor in the attributions of poverty. Conceptualization in the design as to how individuals see poverty outside their immediate environment and how this can affect the formation of their poverty attitudes are suggested as areas for further research.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and locus of control,16

The article begins by discussing the perceived causes of poverty and their taxonomic properties (locus, stability, and controllability). One antecedent of causal beliefs, political ideology, is then examined in detail, followed by a review of the effects of causal beliefs on emotions and behavior. It is contended that helping the poor is a moral issue, but the moral evaluation concerns the targeted recipient of aid rather than the potential help giver. Persons perceived as responsible for their plight, a dominant construal for conservatives, elicit anger and neglect. In contrast, those seen as not responsible for their financial hardship, an outlook predominantly endorsed by liberals, arouse sympathy and help giving. Sympathy is the most important proximal determinant of aid. This analysis is extended to reactions to achievement failure, abortion, and rape.

Mead presented an interesting argument as to why poverty exists in the United States. He problematizes the culture of the poor of which ethnic minorities over-represent. By referring to the geographic regions from which these ethnic minorities came from, he globalised the question of poverty in the US. This invites a global policy debate rather than a US-centric policy debate. Indeed, Mead so freely made references to Africa and the African culture severally throughout his commentary. It is against this backdrop that I show that Mead was right to a large extent on the question of inner-driven individualised orientation. However, he overestimates its influence and misreads what culture is. He presented the culture of poverty as the antecedent of poverty. It was concluded that manipulating both internal drive (internal locus of control) and the structure of society is a more effective way to tackle poverty.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and locus of control,2

Results confirm that students appear to develop beliefs about poverty that are consistent with desired professional values. Beginning, intermediate, and advanced BSW students rated structural explanations as the most salient and accorded the least importance to factors related to personal client deficiencies. However, a rise in fatalistic interpretations of poverty along with an increasingly external locus of control orientation characterized students who had completed their social welfare policy course.

10.2139/ssrn.2514590,The Future in Mind: Aspirations and Forward-Looking Behaviour in Rural Ethiopia,,"Poor people often do not make investments, even when returns are high. One possible explanation is that they have low aspirations and form mental models of their future opportunities which ignore some options for investment. This paper reports on a field experiment to test this hypothesis in rural Ethiopia. Individuals were randomly invited to watch documentaries about people from similar communities who had succeeded in agriculture or business, without help from government or NGOs. A placebo group watched an Ethiopian entertainment programme and a control group were simply surveyed. In addition, the number of people invited was varied by village to assess the importance of peer effects in formation of aspirations. Six months after screening, aspirations had improved among treated individuals and did not change in the placebo or control groups. Treatment effects were larger for those with higher pre-treatment aspirations. We also find treatment effects on savings, use of credit, children’s school enrolment and spending on children’s schooling, suggesting that changes in aspirations can translate into changes in a range of forward-looking behaviours. There are also treatment effects on measures from psychology and sociology, including locus of control, which theory predicts should behave in similar ways to aspirations. Most effects are robust to corrections for multiple testing. Peer effects result in further impact on educational spending and induce more work and less leisure. The result that a one-hour documentary shown six months earlier induces actual behavioural change suggests a challenging, promising avenue for further research and poverty-related interventions.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and locus of control,164

Overall, there was no clear evidence that intervening to change the educational attitudes of disadvantaged students will lead to enhanced attainment. Some mental concepts, such as external motivation, show promise and could be developed further. Others, like locus of control, show little promise and could even be dangerous if used without care. Given that there are other approaches that can help to overcome the poverty gradient in schools, raising aspirations is not the way for policy to go. The stratification of educational outcomes is more likely to be structural rather than mental. An improved attitude without the competence to do something about it could be ineffective, whereas competence may be sufficient in isolation. The current evidence is that attitudes do not cause variation in attainment, and so policies and practices based on a belief that they do are being, and will continue to be, ineffective. Such policies also present opportunity costs, using budget that could be used for more promising approaches, and leaving the poverty gradient largely untouched for yet another generation.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and locus of control,74

These milieus usually have high rates of absolute poverty and relative economic deprivation, as well as weak social institutions. The persistent findings of delinquent peer contributions to delinquency have yet to be tested under conditions where social class and milieu effects are controlled. There is little empirical evidence to determine how adolescents in high‐crime neighborhoods avoid delinquency despite frequent contact with delinquent peers. The differences between violent delinquents and other youths from comparable neighborhoods are little understood. This study contrasts a sample of chronically violent male juvenile offenders with the general male adolescent population (students and school dropouts) from inner‐city neighborhoods in four cities. Violent delinquents differ from other male adolescents in inner cities in their attachments to school, their perceptions of school safety, their associations with officially delinquent peers, their perceptions of weak maternal authority, and the extent to which they have been victims of crime. Peer delinquency and drug“problems” predict the prevalence of three delinquency offense types for both violent offenders and neighborhood youths. Among violent delinquents, there appear to be different explanatory patterns, with one type better described by internal controls (locus of control), a developmental measure. Overall, there is strong support for integrated theory including control and learning components, and similar associations exist among inner‐city youths as in the general adolescent male population. Despite the generally elevated rates of delinquency in inner cities, the explanations of serious and violent delinquency appear the same when subjects are sampled at the extremes of the distribution of behavior.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and locus of control,95

10.1371/journal.pone.0020429,Genetic and Physiological Analysis of Iron Biofortification in Maize Kernels,,"Background Maize is a major cereal crop widely consumed in developing countries, which have a high prevalence of iron (Fe) deficiency anemia. The major cause of Fe deficiency in these countries is inadequate intake of bioavailable Fe, where poverty is a major factor. Therefore, biofortification of maize by increasing Fe concentration and or bioavailability has great potential to alleviate this deficiency. Maize is also a model system for genomic research and thus allows the opportunity for gene discovery. Here we describe an integrated genetic and physiological analysis of Fe nutrition in maize kernels, to identify loci that influence grain Fe concentration and bioavailability. Methodology Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was used to dissect grain Fe concentration (FeGC) and Fe bioavailability (FeGB) from the Intermated B73 × Mo17 (IBM) recombinant inbred (RI) population. FeGC was determined by ion coupled argon plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP). FeGB was determined by an in vitro digestion/Caco-2 cell line bioassay. Conclusions Three modest QTL for FeGC were detected, in spite of high heritability. This suggests that FeGC is controlled by many small QTL, which may make it a challenging trait to improve by marker assisted breeding. Ten QTL for FeGB were identified and explained 54% of the variance observed in samples from a single year/location. Three of the largest FeGB QTL were isolated in sister derived lines and their effect was observed in three subsequent seasons in New York. Single season evaluations were also made at six other sites around North America, suggesting the enhancement of FeGB was not specific to our farm site. FeGB was not correlated with FeGC or phytic acid, suggesting that novel regulators of Fe nutrition are responsible for the differences observed.

Factors that influence emotional disturbance in adults living in extreme poverty. Scandinavian Journal of Psychology 53, 158–164. Living in poverty conditions implies exposure to severe circumstances of social disadvantage, associated with greater propensity to contract illnesses. A negative correlation has consistently been observed between health and poverty. The chronic exposure to stress affects people’s well‐being through the development of symptoms of anxiety and depression. The suffering of these symptoms for a long time period may be considered as part of a more general syndrome of emotional disturbance, in detriment to a person’s mental health. The objective of this study is to identify psychological factors that influence emotional disturbance, measured as symptoms of anxiety and depression, in adults living in poverty conditions in Mexico’s central region. A total of 913 adults, 65.2% female, were surveyed. The mean age of the participants was 43.71 ( ± 12.58) years and the mean number of years of schooling was 4.04 (±3.36). Variables corresponding to personal characteristics were measured. The results indicate that the most important risk factor for depression is anxiety and vice versa. Additionally, gender, negative self‐esteem, lack of adequate strategies for confronting and resolving difficulties, and lack of self‐regulation predicted depression, whereas stress, lack of self‐regulation, and coping style predicted anxiety. These variables were better predictors than optimism, locus of control, sense of humor or religiosity.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and locus of control,20
10.1093/oxfordjournals.bjc.a048191,AN ASSESSMENT OF THE ATTITUDES TOWARDS CRIME AMONG PROFESSIONALS IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,,"Attitudes towards crime held by professionals in the criminal justice system seem to be relevant to the implementation of crime control measures and prison reform programmes. With the aim of describing and comparing the attitudes of these professionals towards the causes, prevention, and treatment of crime, two studies were carried out. In Study 1, a Likert attitude scale was constructed. The Attitudes towards Crime Scale (ACS) showed acceptable levels of reliability and validity. In Study 2 the ACS was administered to various samples of professionals in the criminal justice system. Results showed that attitudes of all groups tended to be favourable to environmental causes and preventive-rehabilitation goals through social assistance. However, expected differences among professional groups were found. Crime prevention and prisoner rehabilitation goals depend in great part on the performance of professionals in the criminal justice system. According to attitude theory (Ajzen and Fishbein 1980), attitudes are predictors of behaviour. Thus, attitudes can be seen as predictors of professional behaviour in interventions relating to crime (Hogarth 1974; Seitz 1989), and accordingly the study of attitudes towards crime held by professionals in the criminal justice system can positively contribute to the implementation of crime control measures and prison rehabilitation programmes (Melvin et al. 1985). From a theoretical point of view, one of the most attractive proposals for explaining attitudes towards crime is that of Carroll et al. (1987). These authors propose a framework for understanding individual differences among criminal justice decision makers and the implications of these differences for sentencing decisions. According to this approach, individual difference variables including sentencing goals (punishment, retribution, rehabilitation, incapacitation, deterrence), attributions about the causes of crime (parental upbringing, mental illness, poverty, and so on), ideology (conserva tism, liberalism) and personality (authoritarianism, dogmatism, locus of control) can be causally ordered. The authors organize these variables by using concepts from both the Ajzen and Fishbein (1980) theory of reasoned action and the attributional analysis of sentencing decisions injudicial circles (Carroll 1978; Diamond and Herhold 1981). The reasoned action theory is a model for explaining attitudes as predictors of behaviour—in this case, attitudes towards crime as predictors of sentencing behaviour.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and locus of control,48

This new language, which has its counterparts in other areas of the law as well, shifts focus away from the traditional concerns of the criminal law and criminology, which have focused on the individual, and redirects it to actuarial consideration of aggregates. This shift has a number of important implications: It facilitates development of a vision or model of a new type of criminal process that embraces increased reliance on imprisonment and that merges concerns for surveillance and custody, that shifts away from a concern with punishing individuals to managing aggregates of dangerous groups, and that affects the training and practice of criminologists.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and locus of control,2264

10.17660/actahortic.2004.643.29,FOOD FOR THE CITIES: URBAN AGRICULTURE IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,,"The processes of population growth and urbanisation will lead to a more or less equal world-wide distribution of population in rural and urban areas by the year 2025. At present, however, there are great differences between the continents. Due to the rapid growth of Southern African cities, the basic needs of the citizens (shelter, food, education etc) are being undermined. Poverty levels in cities are high and research shows they are tending to increase. Recent surveys suggest that the locus of poverty is shifting to urban areas, making food insecurity and malnutrition an urban as well as a rural problem. Urban agriculture is one of the livelihood strategies that vulnerable urban dwellers engage in. The main differences from rural agriculture are limitations of space, access to land, and water quality. In view of the lack of transport in many developing countries, the production of fresh, perishable vegetables in urban areas can be considered as “niche production”, complementary to the rural production of staple food. Urban horticulture is dominating urban food production in many countries. Climatic and cultural conditions clearly affect the kind of production. Production sites are gardens, open spaces (often illegally occupied), road strips and riverbanks, fishponds, rivers, lakes and the proper houses of the families. Urban agriculture is typically informal, often illegal but wide spread, and often done under extremely difficult conditions. Technical assistance to cities is needed to take advantage of the benefits of urban agriculture for city development and urban food security. Urban agriculture may help to solve some of the problems of city authorities through integrated programmes of waste water re-use and organic waste recycling, as well as through the integration of market wastes with urban fodder consumption. URBANIZATION, POVERTY AND FOOD SECURITY The process of population growth and the global process of urbanisation will lead to a more or less equal world-wide distribution of population in rural and urban areas by the year 2025. Over the next 25 years we shall have a dramatic increase of about 4 billion in the number of people in cities. By 2015, nearly 30 Mega cities will emerge, many of them located in Asia, some on the American Continent and two of them in Africa. The urbanisation process is not only creating Megacities but also numerous small, medium and large cities (UNCHS 2001a). Nevertheless it is important to note, that the trend to and the dynamics of the urbanisation process are not the same everywhere – there are great differences among the continents. Up to now, Africa is the least urbanised, with only about 36% urbanisation, although it shows the highest current rates of urbanisation, while Latin America and Asia are similar to Europe, North America and other industrialised countries and are urbanised to three quarters or more. Due to the rapid growth of Southern African cities, the basic needs of the citizen (shelter, food, education etc.) tend to be undermined and local authorities find themselves in the difficult situation of having to face ungovernable conditions. It is estimated that between 1/4 and 1/3 of all urban households in the world live in absolute poverty. Regionally, urban poverty is highest in Africa and Latin America (UNCHS 2001b). Kampala, Lilongwe and Ibadan show the highest poverty levels in Proc. IC on Urban Horticulture Eds: R. Junge-Berberovic et al. Acta Hort 643, ISHS 2004 228 Africa with 60 to 80% urban poor. Households with female heads show significantly higher poverty rates in African cities (WRI 1996). The urban poor are vulnerable to a number of hazards and are always at risk. They live densely packed, subject to heavy rains or sudden fires that can wipe out their homes. They have precarious employment, in the formal or informal sector. They are exposed to a higher incidence of disease, arbitrary arrest and forced eviction. Neglected by formal institutions, they are often left unprotected against violence, drug dealers, corrupt officials, unscrupulous slumlords, and organized crime. Lack of resources, hence lack of political power, is a major cause of their vulnerability. The urban poor spend a disproportionate amount of money on food making them vulnerable to changing macro-economic conditions. Poor residents of Kampala and Accra spend up to 75% of their incomes on food, and still they universally endure decreasing food supply and quality. No formal safety nets address poverty and hunger, and thus the poor have adapted numerous survival strategies (Maxwell 1998). One of the livelihood strategies of the urban dweller is “urban agriculture” and more specifically urban horticulture. While food might be available in markets, many households can hardly afford to buy sufficient food (vegetables in particular) with their limited cash resources. URBAN AGRICULTURE “Real agriculture” was thought to take place in the rural sector only. So the rural and periurban sector were foreseen to feed the urban population. In reality, this undertaking has failed in many countries due to an absence of infrastructure and the lack of purchasing power of the urban poor. Urban agriculture is not just vegetable production or gardening. In many case studies, urban and periurban agriculture is described as a system of different agricultural activities, well integrated into and part of a more or less closed circuit of energy flows and production and consumption pattern. Urban agriculture refers not only to food crops and fruit trees grown in cities but encompasses animals, poultry, bees, rabbits, snakes, guinea pigs and other indigenous animals. Urban fish production is also part of the food system in many tropical cities (Drescher and Iaquinta 1999, FAO 2000). Urban agriculture is emerging strongly in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the fastest urban growth will occur in countries least equipped to feed their cities, but recently a strong increase was also observed in other regions with acute economic crises (e.g. Argentina). Urban agriculture can contribute to the following: ! increased urban food supply and food security through increased availability of food, especially of fresh and perishable foods ! employment and income opportunities for the urban population (including migrants from rural areas) ! improved household food security of the urban poor ! improved urban environment. Most directly, urban agriculture reduces food insecurity if it increases access to food (especially fresh, nutrient-rich foods) among populations suffering from food insecurity (the poor, temporarily or permanently vulnerable). Such populations can do this through their own self-provisioning that directly provides food, or by using what they grow to reduce market expenditure or increase income. As the urban poor are found to be spending most of their income on food, any of these actions can have a major impact on household well-being. No matter whether supported or prohibited, urban agriculture does exist. This reality forces city authorities to take precautions to safeguard the well-being of their residents and the environment. Market oriented food production needs guidance, extension and control to ensure food safety for consumers and healthy conditions for the urban producers. Urban and periurban food production is common in many developing countries but recently is an increasing phenomenon.

Respondents were asked to indicate their personal opinion regarding a range of risk perception belief statements reflecting environmental concern, social concern, genetic concern, dependence on regulators, locus of health risk control (internal, powerful others, chance), risk acceptability and technological enthusiasm. The results indicated considerable concern over the state of the environment in general, however, less concern existed for the environment nearest to the individual. A high degree of concern was expressed over stress in the workplace, and poverty was perceived to represent an important health risk for Canadians. A strong sense of the importance of personal lifestyle factors and personal control over one's health was also observed as were notable increases in trust and dependence on the ability of government and experts to make decisions and regulate health risks in Canada as compared to the previous survey. Belief statements reflecting environmental and social concern correlated with the level of risk perceived for a variety of health hazards and outcomes.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and locus of control,19

There is a great deal of scepticism within international development circles. This scepticism is fuelled by widespread ideas about the political impact of globalisation and by the economistic ways of thinking about politics that are increasingly influential in international development organisations and aid agencies. This scepticism is not justified. Arguments about the political impact of globalisation are exaggerated. Economistic models of politics provide a biased account of the real politics of anti-poverty and lead to undue pessimism about the scope for poor country governments to tackle poverty by redistributing resources.,Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,18

It is shown that recipient regions showed very different patterns of aid inflows and economic growth in the past and that aid flows yielded the highest correlation to growth when their magnitudes shrank. It is furthermore argued that categorising countries by quality of domestic policies is not only questionable at a given point of time especially in countries with failing governmental institutions and open borders as in many African countries. It suffers also from incentive problems so that countries receiving more aid can become victims of changes in their domestic policies which are more permissive and etatist to the disadvantage of private agents. The paper instead pleads for a shift to aid policies decoupled from country‐specifics and more oriented to fundamental ‘beyond border’ problems of the well‐being of the poor.

10.1021/es051670d,Resource-Conserving Agriculture Increases Yields in Developing Countries,,"Despite great recent progress, hunger and poverty remain widespread and agriculturally driven environmental damage is widely prevalent. The idea of agricultural sustainability centers on the need to develop technologies and practices that do not have adverse effects on environmental goods and services, and that lead to improvements in food productivity. Here we show the extent to which 286 recent interventions in 57 poor countries covering 37 M ha (3% of the cultivated area in developing countries) have increased productivity on 12.6 M farms while improving the supply of critical environmental services. The average crop yield increase was 79% (geometric mean 64%). All crops showed water use efficiency gains, with the highest improvement in rainfed crops. Potential carbon sequestered amounted to an average of 0.35 t C ha(-1) y(-1). If a quarter of the total area under these farming systems adopted sustainability enhancing practices, we estimate global sequestration could be 0.1 Gt C y(-1). Of projects with pesticide data, 77% resulted in a decline in pesticide use by 71% while yields grew by 42%.

These stories are well worth our attention. Of course, the comparisons to Maus will be inevitable, as is true for every serious work of graphic narrative written since Spiegelman’s work debuted. But it does this volume an injustice not to take it on its own terms. We’re Still at War vivifies the pain and suffering of these Czech witnesses , from the Second World War through the long Communist era, and provides the reader with historical and emotional insights. Rita D. Jacobs New York City Steven Pinker Enlightenment Now:The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress New York. Viking. 2018. 576 pages. The heart of Steven Pinker’s important new book is in its title: Enlightenment Now. It is a stalwart defense of the ideals of the Enlightenment, recasting them “in the language and concepts of the twenty-first century.” The “Now” in the title and the timing of the book’s publication are by no means coincidental—Enlightenment Now appears both universally applicable as well as acutely relevant in today’s global sociopolitical climate. Pinker divides his book into three parts, using the first to set out what enlightenment is; he identifies humanism—the striving for the flourishing of all humans— as setting its goal and reason and science as guiding its methodology. In the second part, he embarks on a tour de force through fields as diverse as happiness, war, and knowledge to show how, over the last centuries, humans have evoked Enlightenment ideals to bring about substantial progress in each of them. One of the book’s most impressive features is that Pinker’s arguments are not only made in his usual wit and multitude of cultural and intellectual references but also come with a rather impressive wealth of data and historical trends, be those the global decline in extreme poverty and war or the global increase of life expectancy, knowledge , equality, and happiness. Following the staggering optimism of the book’s second part, Pinker places his defense of Enlightenment ideals in the third, cautioning us that progress will not continue inevitably—it is contingent on the ideals that underlie it. One might view reason, science, and humanism to be self-evident. Sadly, history and current events remind us otherwise. And arguably even more important, our own personal biases might infringe on these ideals much more heavily than we are ready to admit. In an age of rekindling nationalism and xenophobia, a defense of democracy, reason , and science is increasingly necessary. Where “[i]n area after area, the world has been getting more rational, [t]here is . . . a flaming exception: electoral politics and the issues that have clung to it.” Throughout the book, Pinker uncovers patterns and fallacies of human thought, which become particularly relevant in our political tribalism . Both on the left and on the right, we subscribe to ideas and vote not primarily for content but for identity alignment. We tend to quickly forgive the indiscretions of those in our own party while rejecting ideas that we might otherwise endorse, purely based on our party’s position. Public discourse today, particularly in the US, is dominated not only by an ever more divergent dichotomy of positions and methodologies but also by rising negativity and fatalism both from the political left and the right. However, Pinker argues that such a “bleak assessment of the state of the world . . . couldn’t-be-more-wrong,” pointing toward the difference between episodes that shape our perceptions and longer-term trends that frequently directly contradict these perceptions. Some may be critical of the level of optimism that Pinker shows for such momentous issues as climate change or artificial general intelligence. Others have spoken out against the case that Pinker makes about the antireason tendencies of universities and the political left more generally. But regardless of one’s views on such points, Pinker’s Enlightenment Now comes at a crucial time, in which we have to concede that “the end of history” as proclaimed by Francis Fukuyama in his synonymous...",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,1055
10.5860/choice.50-5134,"How children succeed: grit, curiosity, and the hidden power of character",,"Why do some children succeed while others fail? The story we usually tell about childhood and success is the one about intelligence: success comes to those who score highest on tests, from preschool admissions to SATs. But in How Children Succeed, Paul Tough argues that the qualities that matter most have more to do with character: skills like perseverance, curiosity, conscientiousness, optimism, and self-control. How Children Succeed introduces us to a new generation of researchers and educators who, for the first time, are using the tools of science to peel back the mysteries of character. Through their stories--and the stories of the children they are trying to help--Tough traces the links between childhood stress and life success. He uncovers the surprising ways in which parents do--and do not--prepare their children for adulthood. And he provides us with new insights into how to help children growing up in poverty. Early adversity, scientists have come to understand, can not only affect the conditions of children's lives, it can alter the physical development of their brains as well. But now educators and doctors around the country are using that knowledge to develop innovative interventions that allow children to overcome the constraints of poverty. And with the help of these new strategies, as Tough's extraordinary reporting makes clear, children who grow up in the most painful circumstances can go on to achieve amazing things. This provocative and profoundly hopeful book has the potential to change how we raise our children, how we run our schools, and how we construct our social safety net. It will not only inspire and engage readers, it will also change our understanding of childhood itself.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,528

The optimism of this debate is paired with a push to control migration through the promotion of temporary migration programmes and initiatives considered to support the regular movement of migrants. This dominant paradigm has come under criticism, however, for overlooking the multidimensional costs of migration for migrants and their families. As evidence on the costs of migration gathers, debates within policy and scholarly arenas have turned to how to integrate human rights into migration and development initiatives. The discourse surrounding this debate largely draws on the capabilities approach, which sees expanding human capabilities as the central role of development. In this paper, we analyse the resulting discourse and implementation of this approach to demonstrate how this theoretical framework is utilised to conceptualise diverse outcomes for migrant worker rights within global governance priorities for managing migration. We argue that greater attention is needed in the application of the capabilities approach in order to resonate with policy-makers without compromising the integrity of the approach or separating migrants from their intrinsic human rights.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,30

The students were identified and randomly selected for the study with the help of their respective schools. AMOS version 24 was used to test the hypothesised model using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The findings revealed a significant direct association between students’ perceptions of poverty and academic optimism. However, no significant indirect influence was found between students’ perceptions of poverty and their academic optimism through government assistance. These findings suggest that government assistance programmes are not necessarily a contributor to students’ academic optimism. The lack of any significant influence between students’ perceptions of poverty and academic optimism, through government assistance, may indicate a need to re-evaluate the existing assistance programmes rendered by the government to students in the urban poor category.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,2

Media discussion of poverty has shifted from arguments that focus on the structural causes of poverty or the social costs of having large numbers of poor to portrayals of the poor as cheaters and chiselers and of welfare programs doing more harm than good. As the frames have shifted, policies have followed. We demonstrate these trends with new indicators of the depth of poverty, the generosity of the government response, and media framing of the poor for the period of 1960–2008. We present a simple statistical model that explains poverty spending by the severity of the problem, gross domestic product, and media coverage.

However, in the voices of public figures and ordinary citizens he now hears a spirit of optimism. The national dialogue is shifting away from the expansion of personal rights and towards enhancement of communal civility, away from efforts to raise self-esteem and towards attempts to arouse social responsibility, away from whose values? and towards our values. Myers analyses in detail the research on educational and other programmes that deal with social problems, explaining which seem to work and why.

10.5860/choice.195387,The health gap: the challenge of an unequal world,,"In Aldous Huxley’s dystopia, Brave New World, there were fi ve castes. The Alphas and Betas were allowed to develop normally. The Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons were treated with chemicals to arrest their development intellectually and physically, progressively more aff ected from Gamma to Epsilon. The result: a neatly stratifi ed society with intellectual function, and physical development, correlated with caste. That was satire, wasn’t it? We would never, surely, tolerate a state of aff airs that stratifi ed people, then made it harder for the lower orders, but helped the higher orders, to reach their full potential. Were we to fi nd a chemical in the water, or in food, that was damaging children’s growth and their brains worldwide, and thus their intellectual development and control of emotions, we would clamour for immediate action. Remove the chemical and allow all our children to fl ourish, not only the Alphas and Betas. Stop the injustice now. Yet, unwittingly perhaps, we do tolerate such an unjust state of aff airs with seemingly little clamour for change. The pollutant is called social disadvantage and it has profound eff ects on developing brains and limits children’s intellectual and social development. Note, the pollutant is not only poverty, but also social disadvantage. There is a clear social gradient in intellectual, social, and emotional development—the higher the social position of families the more do children fl ourish and the better they score on all development measures. This stratifi cation in early child development, from Alpha to Epsilon, arises from inequality in social circumstances. Emphasising social circumstances and the social gradient is not to say that all diff erences in early child development can be linked to the social environment. Were the conditions under which children grew and developed to be equalised there would still be diff erences between individuals in cognition and social and emotional development. Twin studies show substantial heritability of cognitive ability, for example. That said, the Flynn eff ect refers to the substantial increases in IQ scores that have occurred over time that are due to the environment, broadly conceived. The evidence shows clearly that social conditions infl uencing parenting aff ect children’s ability to reach their potential and are the major determinants of the social gradient in early child development. This social gradient, in its turn, has a profound eff ect on children’s subsequent life chances. We see a social gradient in school performance and adolescent health; a gradient in the likelihood of being a 20 year old not in employment, education, or training; a gradient in stressful working conditions that damage mental and physical health; a gradient in the quality of communities where people live and work; in social conditions that aff ect older people; and, central to my concern, a social gradient in adult health. A causal thread runs through these stages of the life course from early childhood, through adulthood to older age and to inequalities in health. The best time to start addressing inequalities in health is with equity from the start. But intervention at any stage of the life course can make a diff erence. Relieving adult poverty, paying a living wage, reduction in fuel poverty, improving working conditions, improving neighbourhoods, and taking steps to reduce social isolation in elderly people can save lives. The health gradient to which these life course infl uences give rise is dramatic. There is a cottage industry, taking subway rides in various cities and showing how life expectancy drops a year for each stop. The gap at the ends of the gradient is truly large. In the London Borough of Westminster, UK, there is an 18 year gap in male life expectancy between the most and least salubrious parts of the borough. Similarly, in the US city of Baltimore there is a 20 year gap at the ends of the gradient. 20 years is huge—it is the gap in life expectancy between women in India and in the USA. Health inequalities are perhaps the most damning indictments of social and economic inequalities. These subway rides used social characteristics of area of residence. We see similar social gradients in health if we classify people by education, wealth, income, or occupational status. All societies have social and economic inequalities and all societies have social gradients in health, but the magnitude varies. At the UCL Institute of Health Equity, London, UK, we led a review of social determinants and health inequalities for the European Commission. As part of that review we examined life expectancy at 25 years by level of education. In each country there is a gradient in life expectancy—the higher the level of education, the longer the life expectancy. Three striking fi ndings emerged from the comparison. First, average life expectancy is lower in the countries of central and eastern Europe than in Sweden, Italy, and Norway. In other words we must add to our concern health inequalities between countries as well as those within countries. If we extend beyond Europe we see diff erences in life expectancy of 40 years and more. Second, the gradient is steeper in the east than in the west. Third, and linked to the steeper gradient, the country diff erences in life expectancy are much greater for people with little education than they are for people with tertiary education. The health risks associated with being low status vary greatly. The variation in health inequalities gives grounds for optimism. The data show shallower socioeconomic gradients are possible. Further, Estonia, Romania, and Hungary are able to achieve good health. They do it for people with tertiary education.

Structural equation modeling examined the relationships between 3 support variables (quality of child services, quality of family services, and family/community support) and 2 outcomes at 36 months (impact on child and impact on family) and determined whether these relationships were mediated by 2 perceptual variables (optimism and confidence in parenting) or moderated by 5 demographic variables (poverty, maternal education, ethnicity, age of initial Individual Family Service Plan, and health at 36 months).Perceived impact of early intervention on both child and family were significantly related to each other. The quality of child services was related to impact on the child but not on the family. The quality of family services was related to both child and family impact. Informal support was not related to perceived impact on children or families but was strongly related to confidence in parenting and optimism. Neither optimism nor confidence in parenting mediated the relationships between services or supports and perceived impact. Minority families and families of children with poor health reported lower quality of services, but these characteristics did not moderate the relationships between services and perceived impact on the child. However, both poverty status and minority status were associated with perceptions of impact on the family.Findings reinforce the role of high-quality services in maximizing perceived impact.

10.1080/13540602.2014.937960,Teacher resilience: theorizing resilience and poverty,,"AbstractIn this article, I hope to provide some novel insights into teacher resilience and poverty on the basis of ten-year long-term ethnographic participatory reflection and action data obtained from teachers (n = 87) in rural (n = 6) and urban (n = 8) schools (n = 14, high schools = 4, primary schools = 10) in three South African provinces. In resilience debates, resilience in poverty-saturated schools is generally indicated as both process and outcome. Evidence from this study posits resilience processes in poverty as a lifeline chain, linking uninterrupted incidences of adaptation one after the other. Thus, rather than once-off incidental processes depicting a clear adversity beginning and positive adaptation end, adapting to poverty calls for resilience qualities characterized as a cable of nonstop vigilance. To mediate risk during resilience processes, the teachers in the study made use of traits such as compassion, creativity, optimism and especially flocking to access and use scarce protective resources. In the lifeline chain of resilience, the teachers demonstrated mostly positive outcomes as well as instances of maladaptation and thriving. Teacher resilience in poverty contexts means that teachers ceaselessly adapt in a sequence of linked incidents to a procession of risks. They use particular traits to unite and direct their adaptive series of behaviors in order to transform high-risk schools into supportive spaces where they sometimes thrive, and sometimes feel distressed but mostly function effectively as teachers.Keywords: teacher resiliencepovertyhigh-risk schoolssupportive schoolsteacher traitsadaptive coping processes",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,96

10.17763/1943-5045-87.4.588,Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance,,"In Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance, Angela Duckworth, professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, looks at grit—passion coupled with perseverance—as being essential to success and achievement. The book pushes back on society’s overreliance on talent to explain excellence and instead highlights what relentless effort and an unwavering focus on a goal can achieve. Duckworth tells the story of grit’s role in human flourishing by weaving together biographies and interviews with highly successful individuals, “grit paragons” (p. 60), with largely jargon-free summaries of psychological research on topics such as passion, optimism, interest, and excellence.The book is organized into three sections: Part 1 introduces the concept of grit and why it matters; Part 2 presents ways in which individuals can grow their grit reserves from the “inside out” (p. 92); and Part 3 presents contexts such as parenting and the workplace that serve as “playing fields” (p. 223) for developing grit.In the opening chapter of Part 1, “Showing Up,” Duckworth introduces readers to grit and to her Grit Scale, which assesses the extent to which an individual “approaches life with grit” (p. 9), with passion and perseverance. Through examples of diverse contexts, ranging from the US Army’s training program at West Point to winners of the National Spelling Bee competition, she seeks to demonstrate that grit is better than many other psychological factors at predicting individual success. For example, drawing from her research in the Chicago Public Schools, Duckworth proposes that grit is a “more powerful predictor of graduation than how much students cared about school, how conscientious they were about their studies, and even how safe they felt at school” (p. 11). Toward the end of the chapter she raises a question that the next chapter tackles: What is the role of talent versus grit in individual success? Chapter 2, “Distracted by Talent,” considers this question and examines the notion that having “potential is one thing [, but] what we do with it is quite another” (p. 14). Through personal anecdotes and examples of towering historical figures such as Charles Darwin, Duckworth highlights humans’ tendency to attribute individual success to a natural gift and innate talent rather than exceptionally hard work or passion. For her, the fundamental folly of our hidden psychological bias favoring talent is that it overshadows the crucial role of effort in driving individual achievement. “Without effort,” she argues, “talent is nothing more than your unmet potential . . . what you could have done but didn’t” (p. 51).In chapter 3, “Effort Counts Twice,” Duckworth elaborates on her theory for getting from talent to achievement via effort. She argues that effort not only leads to developing one’s skills but importantly makes those skills usable and productive, thus having double the impact. While she does not explicitly untangle the relation between effort and grit, she maintains that effort underlies both passion and perseverance. To illustrate this centrality of sustained effort in achievement, she offers familiar, if timeless, advice on being successful from gritty individuals, including Harvard psychologist George Valliant, filmmaker Woody Allen, and novelist John Irving. Duckworth reminds readers that “getting back on the treadmill the next day, eager to try again” is a crucial component of grit, because “when you permanently turn your back on a commitment,” she says, “your effort plummets to zero . . . your skills stop improving, and at the same time, you stop producing anything with whatever skills you have” (p. 50).A core idea of chapter 4, “How Gritty Are You?” is that “grit is all about holding the same top-level goal for a very long time” (p. 66). Using this lens, Duckworth argues that passion signifies “consistency over time” rather than a short-lived burst of “infatuation” (p. 57). Drawing on her interviews with Jeff Gettleman, the East Africa bureau chief of the New York Times, and New Yorker cartoon editor Bob Mankoff, she not only argues for the importance of holding goals but also presents ways to prioritize and organize goals into a hierarchy. The chapter also offers readers the chance to assess their own “grittiness” through an abridged version of Duckworth’s Grit Scale, subject to the caveat that one’s grit score is “a reflection of how you see yourself right now” (p. 56). But chapter 5, “Grit Grows,” proposes that grit can be intentionally honed. Here Duckworth takes on the nature-nurture question—How much of my grit score at this moment is a product of my genes? The answer is not entirely surprising. Similar to almost every other psychological trait, including IQ, Duckworth argues, grit is shaped by genetic factors as well as by experience and environment. More topically, for example, her research found that older individuals score higher on the grit scale. The implications and explanations of this finding are far from conclusive given the absence of longitudinal studies on grit, a limitation Duckworth acknowledges. Nonetheless, with the assumption of grit’s malleability, the rest of the chapter is dedicated to introducing the four “psychological assets” that paragons of grit (p. 92) have in common: interest, practice, purpose, and hope.The four chapters in Part 2 lay out the psychological capacities that drive the development of grit. In chapter 6, “Interest,” Duckworth proclaims that fostering passion takes time, effort, and interaction with the world. The process of interest discovery tends to be “messy, serendipitous, and inefficient” (p. 104). Unsurprisingly, parents, teachers, coaches, mentors, and peers can play a crucial role by facilitating opportunities for tinkering and by providing encouragement to children in their early years. And, as chapter 7, “Practice,” lays out, perseverance hones passion. Duckworth argues that grit grows through hours of “deliberate practice” (p. 120) during which individuals intentionally operate at the far boundaries of their current skill levels. Through anecdotes of Benjamin Franklin improving his writing and of Atul Gawande becoming a surgeon, the chapter seeks to convey that “even the most complex and creative of human abilities can be broken down into its component skills, each of which can be practiced, practiced, and practiced” (p. 123).The final chapters of Part 2 signal the latter two phases in the development of grit. Chapter 8, “Purpose,” argues that purpose lends a larger meaning to any work, whether building pots or writing, and can thus sustain passion over a lifetime. Moreover, this “beyond-the-self orientation” (p. 164) can be intentionally nurtured by observing purposeful role models, discovering a problem that needs solving, and cultivating a belief that one can make a difference. In chapter 9, “Hope,” Duckworth ruminates on the central role of hope in strengthening the capacity to persevere during challenging times. She spends a substantial portion of the chapter laying out the connections between Carol Dweck’s research on fixed versus growth mind-set and grit. She contends that individuals with a growth mind-set are better set up to keep going during tough times than are those with a fixed mind-set.In the concluding section, Duckworth offers her “hunches” (p. 211) from emerging research about the most common practice arenas for growing grit. Chapter 10, “Parenting for Grit,” and Chapter 11, “The Playing Field of Grit,” offer readers guidance on practices and experiences that can foster grit in children. For example, grit is fostered when parents model it and balance stretch and support in their interactions with children. Duckworth also argues that structured extracurricular activities have all the essential ingredients of what it takes to build grit, with the underlying message that developing the capacity for grit in younger years can allow one to transfer it from, say, athletics to other domains. Chapter 12, “Culture of Grit,” looks at the institutions we inhabit. But while Duckworth argues that leveraging “the basic human drive to fit in” (p. 247) is the quicker route to developing grit in a large number of people, the chapter offers few relevant lessons for adults in the workplace or insights into how to go about developing such a “gritty culture” (p. 245).In the final chapter, Duckworth acknowledges that grit is only one of many character traits that matter and, importantly, that the potential social costs and undesirable repercussions of grit remain to be studied. Yet ultimately, for Duckworth, grit provides a much-needed nuance into how we define genius— not as “being able to accomplish great things in life without effort . . . [but as] working toward excellence, ceaselessly, with every element of your being” (p. 277).Since its release in May 2016, Grit has been met both enthusiastically and skeptically. On one hand, for education administrators confronted with the harshly uneven nature of student achievement in US public schools, its study of this popular buzzword holds the tantalizing promise of a means for predicting and supporting academic success. At the same time, the book’s explanation of individual success as fueled by grit is stripped of any context. The sole acknowledgment that “context matters” comes in chapter 3 when the author notes that access to opportunities matters and that her theory about psychology of achievement is “incomplete” (p. 43). However, this is not accompanied by a serious consideration of the many ecological factors—such as race, class, or family income—that viscerally shape and actively deny massive numbers of individuals in the United States (and globally) access to the kinds of resources and opportunities (e.g., a supportive teacher, a spot on the swim team, hours and hours of deliberate practice) that Duckworth sees as crucial to “growing grit” so that individuals can realize their potential. So while the book is a helpful reminder that there is more to excellence than talent, it raises, and largely sidesteps, questions about why schools at the systemic level are struggling to provide enough students opportunities for excellence and mastery that the author advocates as worth pursuing in life.But is grit different from the wisdom passed on across generations— “sustained effort matters,” “show up day after day despite failures and adversities”? In fact, some researchers hold the view that it is not significantly different from its close cousin, conscientiousness (Credé, Tynan, & Harms, 2017). Can grit emerge in the context of poverty, and can it outweigh its impact? Does the promise that effort can predict academic achievement hold up for individuals across chasms of race and class? Questions such as these remain. But, in the words of the “especially gritty” (p. 277) Ta-Nehisi Coates (2015), who has written extensively about structural racism, “every time I ask it, the question is refined” (p. 34). Perhaps a sustained interrogation, rather than an uncritical embrace of the book’s ideas, is essential to realize the role that grit can have in human thriving.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,1427
10.1016/j.atech.2022.100132,"Smart farming and artificial intelligence in East Africa: Addressing indigeneity, plants, and gender",,"Precision agriculture, including the deployment of robotic farm workers, artificial intelligence (AI) driven equipment, and corresponding ""smart"" systems, is being enthusiastically lauded for improving crop yields, strengthening food security, generating economic growth, and combating poverty. Techno-optimism has captured the imagination of media, industry, and governments alike. Simultaneously, researchers in the computer science and machine learning spaces have begun cataloguing potential harms that arise from information technologies that are shaped by bias, discrimination, and Western hierarchies of power. While precision agriculture and smart farming technologies may provide some opportunities for East African smallholder women farmers, they may also emerge as a new—yet familiar—system of appropriation and control over their labor and knowledge. Concurrently, there is a need to address how such technologies continue to reinforce plants as mere objects to be optimized and managed, rather than ""smart"" beings with their own material forces and ways of knowing that shape our worlds. This article considers how precision agriculture and smart farming are potentially managing, surveilling, and optimizing both women farmers and plants in ways that reinforce hierarchies and disregard Indigenous ways of knowing and being. It models a decolonial mode of deliberation toward governing smart farming and related artificially intelligent technologies in more meaningful and inclusive ways.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,19
10.1177/0013916518793482,Techno-Optimism and Farmers’ Attitudes Toward Climate Change Adaptation,,"In industrialized societies, techno-optimism is a belief that human ingenuity, through improved science and technology, will ultimately provide remedies to most current and future threats to human well-being, such as diseases, climate change, and poverty. Here we examine (a) whether techno-optimism is found among Midwestern corn and soybean farmers and (b) how this confidence in human ingenuity influences their support for climate change adaptation. By examining data from a survey of nearly 5,000 grain farmers in the Midwestern United States, we found that greater techno-optimism can reduce farmers’ support for climate change adaptation and increase their propensity to express a preference to delay adaptation-related actions. This study advances our understanding of how social and cognitive factors influence farmers’ attitude toward climate change. Findings from this study can also help extension educators to develop outreach programs that are sensitive to farmers’ views about the ability of science and technology to solve climate change–related issues.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,72
10.5860/choice.43-1202,A normal country: Russia after communism,,"uring the 1990s, Russia underwent extraordinary transformations.It changed from a communist dictatorship into a multiparty democracy in which officials are chosen in regular elections.Its centrally planned economy was reshaped into a capitalist order based on markets and private property.Its army withdrew peacefully from eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics, allowing the latter to become independent countries.Twenty years ago, only the most naı ¨ve idealist could have imagined such a metamorphosis.Yet the mood among Western observers has been anything but celebratory.By the turn of the century, Russia had come to be viewed as a disastrous failure and the 1990s as a decade of catastrophe for its people.Journalists, politicians and academic experts typically describe Russia not as a middle-income country struggling to overcome its communist past and find its place in the world, but as a collapsed and criminal state.In Washington, both left and right have converged on this view.To Dick Armey, then Republican House majority leader, Russia had by 1999 become ""a looted and bankrupt zone of nuclearized anarchy"" (Schmitt, 1999).To his colleague, Banking Committee Chairman James Leach (1999a, b), Russia was ""the world's most virulent kleptocracy,"" more corrupt than even Mobutu's Zaire.Bernard Sanders (1998), the socialist congressman from Vermont, described Russia's economic performance in the 1990s as a ""tragedy of historic proportions""; liberal reforms had produced only ""economic collapse,"" ""mass unemployment"" and ""grinding poverty.""More recently, a glimmer of optimism returned.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,242

The study explored how different family and individual environmental factors foster academic resilience. The exploratory study took place with a group of six students from a public school in Bogotá, Colombia. The school is located in a low-income and marginalized area of the city, where social problems such as poverty and violence are common. Data collection techniques included document analysis, as well as interviews with teachers and parents. The data collection was focused on identifying how academic resiliency skills can be developed in vulnerable young people. It was found that it is possible to identify and describe different protective factors from the family, such as family guidance, family support, and opportunities for meaningful family involvement that explicitly foster academic resilience in at risk-students. It was also possible to address how individual characteristics also foster positive outcomes, including optimism, perseverance, or motivation.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,129
10.1080/01436597.2011.604520,Disability and Poverty: the need for a more nuanced understanding of implications for development policy and practice,,"Abstract The international development community is beginning to recognise that people with disabilities constitute among the poorest and most vulnerable of all groups, and thus must be a core issue in development policies and programmes. Yet the relationship between disability and poverty remains ill-defined and under-researched, with few studies providing robust and verifiable data that examine the intricacies of this relationship. A second, linked issue is the need for—and current lack of—criteria to assess whether and how disability-specific and disability ‘mainstreamed’ or ‘inclusive’ programmes work in combating the exclusion, marginalisation and poverty of people with disabilities. This article reviews existing knowledge and theory regarding the disability–poverty nexus. Using both established theoretical constructs and field-based data, it attempts to identify what knowledge gaps exist and need to be addressed with future research.

10.1002/polq.12303,Brazil: Reversal of Fortune,,"Despite recent problems of economic stagnation and social unrest, Brazil, in the last 20 years, has undergone a striking reversal of fortune. Policymaking institutions have improved, and better economic and social policies have resulted, leading to sustained low inflation, a long economic boom, and significant reductions in Brazil's notoriously high levels of poverty and inequality. These advances in governability and policy quality confounded the pessimistic predictions that dominated analyses of Brazil during the country's first decade of democracy (1985–1995). Yet they have also generated a degree of optimism about Brazil's economic and political future that probably is not warranted. Precisely how—and how much—has Brazil changed for the better since the early 1990s? Can we find a reasonable middle ground between the excessive pessimism of early analyses and the excessive optimism of more recent ones? For a reader interested in these questions, there are few better places to look than Alfred P.

10.1111/j.1728-4465.2000.00274.x,Can Poor Countries Surmount High Maternal Mortality?,,"Does poverty bind developing countries to high levels of maternal death in childbirth? Or, as safe‐motherhood advocates claim, do public health and social policy interventions have the potential to accelerate maternal mortality transitions? Globally, almost one in 200 live births leads to the death of the mother, making maternal mortality an issue of critical international import. This article presents an analysis of the determinants of national maternal mortality levels with a view to shedding light on these questions. A cross‐national regression of 64 countries shows that wealth indicators explain only a portion of the variance in national maternal mortality levels. Other determinants, including women's educational levels and the proportion of deliveries attended by trained health personnel, are more clearly associated with national maternal mortality levels than are measures of wealth. The results offer grounds for optimism concerning the potential for global safe‐motherhood efforts to induce maternal mortality transitions.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,100
10.5860/choice.50-6142,One billion hungry: can we feed the world?,,"Hunger is a daily reality for a billion people. More than six decades after the technological discoveries that led to the Green Revolution aimed at ending world hunger, regular food shortages, malnutrition, and poverty still plague vast swaths of the world. And with increasing food prices, climate change, resource inequality, and an ever-increasing global population, the future holds further challenges.In One Billion Hungry, Sir Gordon Conway, one of the world's foremost experts on global food needs, explains the many interrelated issues critical to our global food supply from the science of agricultural advances to the politics of food security. He expands the discussion begun in his influential The Doubly Green Revolution: Food for All in the Twenty-First Century, emphasizing the essential combination of increased food production, environmental stability, and poverty reduction necessary to end endemic hunger on our planet. Conway addresses a series of urgent questions about global hunger: * How we will feed a growing global population in the face of a wide range of adverse factors, including climate change? * What contributions can the social and natural sciences make in finding solutions?* And how can we engage both government and the private sector to apply these solutions and achieve significant impact in the lives of the poor?Conway succeeds in sharing his informed optimism about our collective ability to address these fundamental challenges if we use technology paired with sustainable practices and strategic planning.Beginning with a definition of hunger and how it is calculated, and moving through issues topically both detailed and comprehensive, each chapter focuses on specific challenges and solutions, ranging in scope from the farmer's daily life to the global movement of food, money, and ideas. Drawing on the latest scientific research and the results of projects around the world, Conway addresses the concepts and realities of our global food needs: the legacy of the Green Revolution; the impact of market forces on food availability; the promise and perils of genetically modified foods; agricultural innovation in regard to crops, livestock, pest control, soil, and water; and the need to both adapt to and slow the rate of climate change. One Billion Hungry will be welcomed by all readers seeking a multifaceted understanding of our global food supply, food security, international agricultural development, and sustainability.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,160
10.3109/00952998509016863,Trends in Drug Use of Indian Adolescents Living on Reservations: 1975-1983,,"AbstractAnonymous surveys on drug use were administered to 7th-12th grade students in Indian reservation schools. A large number of tribes were surveyed from 1975 through 1983. There is reason to believe the results are reasonably representative of Indian youth living on reservations. Lifetime prevalence for most drugs is higher than that for non-Indian youth throughout this period, and rates for alcohol, marijuana, and inhalants, the most frequently tried drugs, were particularly high. Since 1981 there has been a slight drop in lifetime prevalence for most drugs. Current use figures show the same trends, with increasing current use through 1981 and a drop since that time. Analysis of patterns of drug use, classifying youth according to number, type, and depth of involvement with drugs, shows a similar trend, with radical increases until 1981 and then a drop in all but one of the more serious drug use types. Despite this drop, 53% of Indian youth would still be classified as ""at risk"" in their drug involvement, compared with 35% of non-Indian youth. Reasons probably relate to severely detrimental conditions on reservations; unemployment, prejudice, poverty, and lack of optimism about the future.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,92
10.1080/02681102.1998.9525287,Utilising information and communication technologies for development: The social dimensions,,"Abstract The literature on information and communication technologies (ICTs) is filled with rising optimism about the contribution of these technologies to economic and social development and their potential to transform developing countries into ""modern"" and knowledge‐based societies. However, as yet very little is known about the veracity of these claims, much less about the long‐term impact that ICTs may have on a country's social and cultural systems. While not refuting the developmental impact of ICTs, this paper argues that it is unlikely that quantum leap reversals of marginalization and poverty will result from technology transfer to the developing world. If nothing else, past experience shows that the notion of leapfrogging stages of development as a result of application of new technologies is dangerously naive and unrealistic. The paper cautions that developing country governments and international agencies should undertake a more rigorous analysis of the social and cultural dimensions of ICTs in order to be able to design appropriate policies and programmes which will enable countries to harness ICTs for development in their own context. It concludes that the best long‐term development investment that can be made using ICTs is to apply them to the training and education of the new generation, rather than to transform these technologies into short‐term ends in themselves. To achieve this, it is necessary to move towards strategic and better integrated national information, communication, and education policies.

10.1177/003172170608800206,Ten Big Effects of the No Child Left behind Act on Public Schools,,"TEST-DRIVEN accountability is now the norm in public schools, a result of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, which is the culmination of 15 years of standards-based reform. Many state and local officials believe that this reliance on tests is too narrow a measure of educational achievement, but NCLB has directed greater attention to low-achieving students and intensified efforts to improve persistently low-performing schools. For the past four years, the Center on Education Policy (CEP), an independent nonprofit research and advocacy organization, has been conducting a comprehensive and continuous review of NCLB, producing the annual reports contained in the series From the Capital to the Classroom as well as numerous papers on specific issues related to the law. (1) Each year, the CEP gathers information for this review by surveying officials in all the state departments of education, administering a questionnaire to a nationally representative sample of school districts, conducting case studies of individual school districts and schools, and generally monitoring the implementation of this important national policy. TEN EFFECTS Ten major effects of NCLB on American education are evident from this multi-year review and analysis. We describe these effects broadly, because our purpose is to assess the overall influence of this policy on public schools. The effects on particular schools and districts may be different. 1. State and district officials report that student achievement on state tests is rising, which is a cause for optimism. It's not clear, however, that students are really gaining as much as rising percentages of proficient scores would suggest. Scores on state tests in reading and mathematics that are used for NCLB purposes are going up, according to nearly three-fourths of the states and school districts, and the achievement gaps on these same tests are generally narrowing or staying the same. States and districts mostly credit their own policies as important in attaining these results, although they acknowledge that the adequate yearly progress (AYP) requirements of NCLB have also contributed. However, under NCLB, student achievement is equated with the proportion of students who are scoring at the proficient level on state tests, and states have adopted various approaches in their testing programs, such as the use of confidence intervals, that result in more test scores being counted as proficient. In addition, some national studies support our survey findings of increased student achievement, while others do not. 2. Schools are spending more time on reading and math, sometimes at the expense of subjects not tested. To find additional time for reading and math, the two subjects that are required to be tested under NCLB and that matter for accountability purposes, 71% of districts are reducing time spent on other subjects in elementary schools--at least to some degree. The subject most affected is social studies, while physical education is least affected. In addition, 60% of districts require a specific amount of time for reading in elementary schools. Ninety-seven percent of high-poverty districts have this requirement, compared to 55%-59% of districts with lower levels of poverty. 3. Schools are paying much more attention to the alignment of curriculum and instruction and are analyzing test score data much more closely. Changes in teaching and learning are occurring in schools that have not made AYP for two years. The most common improvements are greater alignment of curriculum and instruction with standards and assessments, more use of test data to modify instruction, use of research to inform decisions about improvement strategies, improvement in the quality and quantity of professional development for teachers, and the provision of more intensive instruction to low-achieving students. 4. Low-performing schools are undergoing makeovers rather than the most radical kinds of restructuring. …",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,167

From a risk-and-resiliency perspective, hopelessness was approached as a culturally specific response to family stress and other challenges encountered by Mexican immigrants. Although Mexican-heritage women and other Latinas have higher prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders than their male counterparts, they experience disparity in accessing mental health services. Multiple regression analysis was used to explore the relationships among hopelessness, depression, social support, and other variables. Culturally rooted resiliency and a sense of optimism connected to immigration appear to shelter Mexican-heritage mothers from hopelessness and depression. A very large households and nonworking status were found to elevate the risk of hopelessness. Because poverty and acculturation levels were not related to hopelessness or depression, further culturally specific research distinguishing hopelessness from depression is recommended. Given that hopelessness sometimes presents itself independently from depression, implications for practice include the need to refine mental health assessment tools to capitalize on the resiliency among immigrant mothers and avoid misdiagnosis.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,66
10.2307/2938383,"Food Security, Population and Environment",,Human needs are increasingly in jeopardy due to food production. The expansion of food production has cost permanent loss of top soil (24 billion tons/year). In spite of hugh gains made in food production the number of hungry people has increased. Social political and economic constraints determine the extent to which food resources reach those in need. Underlying the constraints are inequities in land ownership frequent choice of low nutrition and perishable foods unequal access to inputs and farm credit limited availability of jobs inequalities in the food market and continuing political neglect. The following issues are discussed: 1) nutritional security maldistribution and absolute shortages; 2) the loss of productivity from the sea; 3) constraints on food production; 4) the need for more suitable farmland; 5) soil depletion; 6) the loss of biodiversity; 7) the loss of genetic diversity; 8) the need reordering of priorities on use of fertilizers irrigation and pesticides; 9) the prospects for expanding food production through genetic engineering reducing postharvest losses and diverting feed to food; and 10) the environmental constraints on increasing food production (air pollution global warming and the population-environment-food interaction). Understanding of agricultural systems and ecology is given as the reason that the American agricultural community and political leaders remain so detached. University training of agronomists has been deficient in providing adequate contact with ecological science in contrast to pure biology. Revelle did not include the possibility that global change may reduce productivity. Optimism is based on blind assumptions that present market systems will effectively respond to environmental deterioration. Nathan Keyfitz has rightly isolated a key empirically backed point of knowledge: that bad politics are widespread and persistent. In order to achieve a theoretically biophysical limit of food production natural capital will irreversibly be depleted and a high standard of living will be compromised. Slowly evolving trends are difficult to see. Social changes are needed to control population invest in agricultural sectors of developing countries reorganize the world trade system for food reduce maldistribution of food and alleviate poverty. 10 billion people much less 5 billion people cannot be nourished even temporarily without these changes.,Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,211
10.1080/02601370.2016.1164468,Continuums of precarity: refugee youth transitions in American high schools,,"This article examines how the pre-migratory experiences of 90 Bhutanese, Burmese, and Iraqi refugee youth shape their aspirations, needs and capabilities as they transition to postsecondary education and work in the American urban context. It further explores how their schooling experiences in precarious urban school districts influence their trajectories. Drawing on two ethnographic projects spanning three years each, the authors rely on participant observation, semi-formal and formal interviews, focus groups, and documents for their analysis. The authors apply the notion of 'cruel optimism' to explain the translation of refugee youths' aspirations post-arrival as they transition from war, refugee camps and illegal alienage to the grim landscape of public education in postindustrial cities like Philadelphia. Coping with residual trauma, interrupted schooling and the pressures of poverty, youth experience a 'continuum of precarity' in their lives that begins in their flight contexts and extends into their post-resettlement social worlds. As public education becomes increasingly unstable, their narratives offer a lens to consider the moral contradictions of third country refugee resettlement. Future research should tease out the unique and multiple transitions refugee youth make across contexts and how their interactions with educative institutions belie the humanitarian promise of better lives.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,64

As well as the economic optimism evident in the 'knowledge-driven poverty reduction' discourse, social equity goals underscore the reform and expansion of the system. Notwithstanding the widening participation and the equity policy provisions put in place, the problem of inequality has persisted along the lines of ethnicity, gender, rurality and socio-economic background. This paper reviews major equity policy instruments and highlights the enduring inequalities in Ethiopian HE. It argues that this persistence is related in part to the ways in which the problem is represented in policy, and that redressing the problem necessitates framing inequality as capability deprivation rather than as issues of access and disparities in enrolment.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Optimism,47

Explanations given for why there are poor people in America may reveal much about underlying structured inequality legitimating mechanisms. Using multiple regression, one-way ANOVA, and frequency distribution analyses, I uncover a conservative-liberal continuum underlying American poverty cause attributions. Past explanations for the mostly mixed nature of American attributions toward poverty are questioned. I suggest a more simple and straightforward explanation: mixed attribution styles, situated on a conservative-liberal continuum, may arise from American's distinguishing between at least two groups of poor people—""deserving"" and ""undeserving""—suggesting policy and future research agendas.

Drawing from cognitive dissonance theory, it was argued that adherents of the Just World Belief redefine and reinterpret perceived inequalities in order to reduce or eliminate the contradiction between the two cognitions. Using data from a probability sample of adults, six hypotheses were formally stated and empirically tested. All six were supported. The greater the acceptance of the Just World Belief, the greater the likelihood of perceiving inequalities as fair, inevitable, and immutable. Also, the belief was positively related to the odds of derogating the poor, praising the wealthy, and favoring individualistic explanations of inequalities over structural ones. Lastly, the Just World Belief was inversely related to the likelihood of perceiving inequalities as extensive.

Lay explanations for “wealth” have been neglected in research on beliefs about social stratification. This study compares the nature and determinants of beliefs about the causes of both wealth and poverty, with special focus on race/ethnic differences. Methods. Using survey data collected from Los Angeles County residents in 2000, descriptive and multivariate procedures are used to analyze “individualistic” and “structuralist” beliefs about wealth and poverty. In addition, one “fatalistic” belief, asking about the role of “God's will” in shaping wealth and poverty, is examined. Analyses test (1) whether race/ethnicity and other social and political characteristics variables shape these stratification beliefs, and (2) whether African Americans, Latinos, and whites differ in the determinants of beliefs about wealth and poverty. Results. Respondents favor individualistic over structuralist reasons for wealth, but favor structuralist over individualistic beliefs in explaining poverty. Fatalistic beliefs are least popular. On beliefs about wealth, African Americans, Latinos, and whites show similar levels of support for individualistic explanations; however, the race/ethnic minorities are both more structuralist than whites on this issue. On beliefs about poverty, the race/ethnic minorities are simultaneously more structuralist and more individualistic than are whites. Social‐class identification and self‐reported conservatism both significantly impact beliefs about wealth and poverty, and do so differently across race/ethnic lines. Conclusions. Findings support the separate treatment and examination of beliefs about wealth and poverty, and reinforce recent calls for greater attention to “nonwhites” in studies of sociopolitical attitudes.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Beliefs,141

In addition, the question of whether African Americans, Latinos, and whites differ in the effects of key religious affiliations is examined. Results . Significant religious affiliation effects are found, net of sociodemographic controls. Protestants and Catholics are strongest on individualistic beliefs; Jews and followers of “other” religions are strongest on structuralist beliefs; Catholics and Jews are strongest on fatalistic beliefs. Finally, race/ethnic differences are found for the effects of key religious affiliations. Conclusion . The analyses demonstrate “religious factors” shaping beliefs about poverty, and reinforce the growing body of evidence that affiliations such as Protestant and Catholic have distinctive meanings and effects along race/ethnic lines in the United States.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Beliefs,101

10.1111/j.1533-8525.1996.tb00746.x,Toward A Revised Framework for Examining Beliefs About the Causes of Poverty,,"This study uses survey data from Baltimore, Maryland to assess predictions from the dominant ideology thesis and the public arenas theory concerning causal beliefs about three specific types of poverty—welfare dependency, homelessness and impoverished migrant laborers. Findings indicate that the incidence and determinants of causal beliefs are more complex than has been reached in prior “generic” poverty research and the findings provide greater support for the public arenas theory. Three findings are of particular note: (1) sample respondents have distinctive causal beliefs for different types of poverty: for welfare dependency, individualistic beliefs are dominant; for homelessness, structural causes are emphasized; a causal “middle ground” is most popular for impoverished migrant laborers (2) status characteristics do not operate as determinants of causal beliefs in a straightforward fashion for any of the three poverty types and, (3) variables that measure types of exposure to, and perceived racial composition of, the poor are also significant determinants of causal beliefs. The effects of variables that measure perceived racial composition are particularly strong and the pattern of “color coding” suggests that racial prejudice shapes causal beliefs about the plight of the poor. The implications of the findings for the mobility opportunities of the three impoverished groups are discussed.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Beliefs,95

This study first identifies the ideological and political nature of this position in relation to the classically ideological individualistic and structural beliefs about poverty. Second, it tests a block variable regression model of popular support for the various belief sets to determine how deeply Americans divide along traditional ideological lines. This model includes not only objective status and demographic factors but subjective variables as well. The results indicate only shallow cleavages in beliefs about poverty and account for why previous studies found deeper ones. Support for the institutional discrimination position is especially broad and is independent of support for individualistic or structural beliefs. These findings suggest that this position and its policy represent a successful political compromise and a viable way for people to resolve their ideological inconsistencies.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Beliefs,75

Socioeconomic status is best described as a consistent, but weak predictor of beliefs about the motivation of the poor and of support for greater efforts to aid the poor. What have generally been referred to as middle-class misconceptions about the motivation of the poor are often held by the poor themselves. Evidence is presented indicating that a marked decrease in extent of commitment to the work ethic could have a substantial impact on beliefs about the poor and the extent of support for efforts to reduce the degree of economic inequality.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Beliefs,84

In this article, the authors contribute to this literature by adding a community-level measure of “concentrated disadvantage” (poverty and associated conditions) to models predicting support for individualistic (person-centered) and structuralist (system-challenging) beliefs about the causes of poverty. Using data from two Los Angeles County surveys and the 1990 Census, multi-level linear and logistic regression models reveal that higher levels of concentrated disadvantage are associated with increased support for both individualist and structuralist explanations of poverty—a “dual consciousness” pattern the authors attribute to increased exposure to social conditions that simultaneously foster sympathetic and antagonistic attitudes toward the poor. These findings add useful information to our knowledge of stratification beliefs and contribute to a growing body of studies showing that “place-level” factors can be important determinants of beliefs and attitudes net of individual-level covariates.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Beliefs,53

However, only a small body of research has focused on Black and Latinx adolescents' developing beliefs about the causes of poverty or the relationship between such beliefs and their awareness of racism. The present study sought to contribute to this scholarship with a longitudinal investigation involving Black and Latinx adolescents (n = 457) attending urban secondary schools in 5 northeastern cities. Specifically, we investigated (a) these adolescents' change over time in their beliefs about the causes of poverty; (b) the relationship between their developing beliefs about the causes of poverty and changes in their awareness of racism; and (c) the role of a progressive schooling experience in influencing the adolescents' beliefs about the causes of poverty. Multivariate latent growth modeling revealed that participants demonstrated significant positive change over time in their conception of poverty as caused by structural factors as well as a significant relationship at each time point between adolescents' beliefs about the causes of poverty and awareness of interpersonal racism. However, we found that attending a secondary school featuring a progressive schooling model did not significantly predict adolescents' change in beliefs about the structural causes of poverty.

This paper examines baccalaureate nursing students’ beliefs about the relationship between poverty and health, and the factors that influence these beliefs. Background. The relationship between poverty and health is well established, and poverty remains a persistent problem in many industrialized nations. Nurses’ understanding of how poverty influences health will affect how they interact with individual clients as well as the strategies they employ to address poverty‐related issues. No studies have examined nursing students’ understandings of how poverty influences health and the factors that influence that understanding. Methods. A cross‐sectional survey of a random sample ( n = 740) of basic baccalaureate nursing students was conducted in three Canadian universities in 2000. Students completed a 59‐item questionnaire eliciting data on demographic variables, personal and educational exposure to poverty, beliefs about the relationship between poverty and health (myth, drift, behavioural, structural), and attitudes to poverty. Results. Students were most likely to adhere to a structural explanation of the relationship between poverty and health. Very little of the variance in myth and drift explanations was accounted for by course or personal exposure, programme level, age, and attitudes toward poverty. Greater course exposure and more positive attitudes toward the poor predicted support for the structural explanation. Support for the behavioural explanation was influenced by attitudes toward the poor and, to a lesser extent, by course exposure, age, and programme level. Conclusion. Students would benefit from greater exposure to poverty through coursework that emphasizes the structural factors contributing to poverty and its negative health consequences. Classroom experience should be complemented with clinical placements that provide students with opportunities to interact with families living in poverty and to work collaboratively with others to address the causes and consequences of poverty at community and policy levels.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Beliefs,35

10.1093/sf/sox007,Being and Becoming Poor: How Cultural Schemas Shape Beliefs About Poverty,,"Prior research on stratification beliefs has investigated individuals’ understandings regarding the causes of poverty in America. These past studies have uncovered demographic characteristics associated with individualist and structuralist explanations for poverty. In the current study, we will argue that Americans, like social scientists, envision poverty as a heterogeneous and complex phenomenon. We utilize a cultural cognition theoretical approach to conceptualize these understandings of poverty as schemas. We contend that a schema of poverty contains a set of unique associations regarding both demographic beliefs (who the poor are) and causal attributions (why they are poor). Using original data in a mixed-methods design that incorporates inductive and experimental components, we find that people differentiate between two key types of poverty: intergenerational poverty and downward mobility. People perceive each type of poverty as caused by a different set of factors and as experienced by a different group of people. The type of poverty envisioned is, in most cases, as important as or more important than a respondent’s own demographic characteristics in predicting what type of causal attributions he or she makes for poverty. These findings underscore the importance of investigating different schemas of poverty in future stratification beliefs research.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Beliefs,30
10.1108/01443331111104805,Public beliefs regarding the causes of poverty during transition,,"Purpose Low‐income transitional countries in the region of the Caucasus and Central Asia lack the existence of a solid assessment of public perceptions regarding the causes of poverty during transition. The purpose of this paper is to fill that gap in the existing literature. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses the secondary analysis of a recent cross‐sectional multinational survey to shed light on public beliefs of the causes of poverty in seven countries of the region – Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. In addition, Russia and Ukraine are used as a comparison point. The theoretical framework for this study is that the subjective beliefs regarding the explanations of poverty can be classified into three broad groups: individualistic, fatalistic, and structural. Hence, regression coefficients and marginal effects of the multinomial logit regression model (MNLM) are estimated to associate the set of various individual, households, and community characteristics selected in the conceptual framework with the likelihood of choosing one of the three afore‐mentioned explanations of poverty. Findings The results of cross‐tabulation reveal that in a majority of the countries studied, the predominant explanation for poverty is structural, with the exception of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, where predominant explanations are, respectively, fatalistic and individualistic. The results of MNLM show that most individual, household, and community characteristics possess the expected direction and are in line with previous findings. However, some of the characteristics have a similar significant effect across several countries, while other characteristics are significant for a single country only. Social implications These findings demonstrate that despite the dominant post‐socialist ideology which favors individualistic and fatalistic explanations of poverty based on the economic rationality of market capitalism, the efforts of the elites in promoting and imposing these ideologies has not been fully successful. Nevertheless, no single unified model of the determinants of beliefs regarding the causes of poverty in the countries of the region is observed. Originality/value This is one of the very few papers aimed at assessing public perceptions regarding the causes of poverty in transitional countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Beliefs,21

In our Midwestern college sample (n = 209), attitudes toward the poor were found to be significantly more negative than attitudes toward the middle class. In addition, participants were most likely to blame poor people them‐selves for their poverty.

Prospective analyses further showed that the relations between these two domains were bi-directional in nature. Parent-adolescent differences (parents vs. adolescents) and parental differences (fathers vs. mothers) in the linkages between beliefs about causes of poverty and psychological well-being were found.

We contrast two alternative explanations: gender-trait stereotypes, emphasizing a candidate's gender-linked personality traits; and gender-belief stereotypes, placing greatest importance on the differing political outlooks of male and female candidates. We test contrasting predictions from these two approaches with data from an experiment in which 297 undergraduate participants were randomly assigned to hear about a male or a female candidate with typically masculine or feminine traits. Overall, there was stronger support for the trait approach. Warm and expressive candidates were seen as better at compassion issues; instrumental candidates were rated as more competent to handle the military and economic issues. Moreover, masculine instrumental traits increased the candidate's perceived competence on a broader range of issues than the feminine traits of warmth and expressiveness. Finally, there was some limited support for the belief approach with gender-based expectations about the candidates' political views affecting their rated competency on compassion but not other types of political issues.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Beliefs,1277

I will argue that the populist wave is challenging the sources of existing well-being in both the less-dynamic and the more prosperous areas and that better, rather than more, place-sensitive territorial development policies are needed in order to find a solution to the problem.

Drawing on research about attributions of poverty, subjective well-being, and relative income, this experimental study assesses the effects of an online poverty simulation (entitled Spent) on participants’ beliefs, attitudes, and actions. Results show that, compared with a control group, Spent players donated marginally more money to a charity serving the poor and expressed higher support for policies benefitting the poor, but were less likely to take immediate political action by signing an online petition to support a higher minimum wage. Spent players also expressed greater subjective well-being than the control group, but this was not associated with increased policy support or donations. Spent players who experienced greater presence (perceived realism of the simulation) had higher levels of empathy, which contributed to attributing poverty to structural causes and support for anti-poverty policies. We draw conclusions for theory about the psychological experience of playing online poverty simulations, and for how they could be designed to stimulate charity and support for anti-poverty policies.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Beliefs,14

We assessed the effect of this interactive, interprofessional, community-based educational experience on students’ attitudes and beliefs about poverty and health.Methods and Findings: Participants (N = 119) completed two measures at the beginning and end of the five-week project: the 37-item Attitudes toward Poverty Scale (APS) and the 8-item Beliefs about the Relationship between Poverty and Health (BRPH). APS scores showed a modest significant increase toward more positive attitudes over time (F(1, 110) = 7.97, p &lt; .01). On the BRPH, participants agreed significantly less at Week 5 with two behavioral explanations (F(1, 114) = 5.07, p &lt; .05; F(1, 114) = 11.00, p &lt; .01) and one structural explanation (F(1, 112) = 11.09, p &lt; .01) about relationships between poverty and health.

10.1111/jasp.12947,The implications of mindsets of poverty for stigma against those in poverty,,"Abstract Belief systems, which can feed, or diminish, stigma are important predictors of poverty reduction efforts. In the current work, we focused on mindsets, which are beliefs about the changeability (growth mindsets) or the stability (fixed mindsets) of the level of poverty in society. We conducted six studies, two preregistered, using both cross‐sectional ( N = 763) and experimental methods ( N = 1361). First, we found support for our prediction that mindsets of poverty can serve to justify economic inequities. To this end, we explored the relationship of these mindsets with system justifying ideologies, we conducted experimental studies designed to motivate, or not, justification processes, and we examined the association between mindsets of poverty and stigma toward those disadvantaged within the economic system. Next, building upon a rich literature on mindsets, we explored the mechanisms by which mindsets predict stigma. Growth mindsets of poverty predicted less stigma, in part, through lower levels of essentializing those in poverty and blaming dispositional factors for economic inequality. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this work for efforts to counter negative attitudes and promote support for those living in poverty.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Mindset,5

The study was done by means of an exploratory, descriptive and contextual strategy inquiry conducted within a qualitative paradigm. Although both approaches led to changes on personal, organisation and community levels, changes differed in various ways in these three systems. The ABCD approach succeeded in enabling community members to engage and participate meaningfully with each other, and undergo consciousness changes from a poverty-influenced mindset to citizens who created and drove their projects in the community. The community members led their own development by co-investing their own assets, and enhanced these with assets from the outside. In comparison, communities not sensitised to ABCD were usually driven by the organisations, based on the needs and problems of communities. Securing funds for development initiatives and the rendering of services seemed to be a major focus. Communities who followed the problem-based approach were better off in the short-term, although projects showed less signs of sustainability.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Mindset,60

We conducted six studies, two pre‐registered, using both cross‐sectional ( N = 763) and experimental methods ( N = 1361). Growth mindsets of poverty in society predicted greater support for redistributive policies, in part through decreased blame, although there was also a small but unreliable negative indirect effect through social class essentialism. The three experimental studies, each using a different approach, were successful in manipulating mindsets of poverty. However, only the approach leveraging system justifying beliefs had implications for blame, essentialist beliefs, and indirect consequences for policy support.

They are key agents in the education of future leaders that will contribute to the successful United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) implementation. The geography of SDGs this implementation is very heterogeneous, but it is clear that higher education institutions contribute decisively to creating a mindset that facilitates the dissemination of SDGs principle. This perspective paper analyses the impacts of higher education on sustainability and the challenges and barriers associated with this process. Higher education contributes decisively to the SDGs implementation, but especially to Goal 1 (end poverty in all its forms everywhere), Goal 3 (ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages), Goal 5 (gender equality), Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth), Goal 12 (responsible consumption and production), Goal 13 (climate change) and Goal 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions). As a transformational agent, the higher education sector has a tremendous impact on students' habit and contribution to a prosperous society. However, to establish the required change in education, sustainability principles need to be at the heart of higher institutions strategy (e.g., curricula, modus operandi) and is key to be incorporated in the organisational culture. Only by leading by example, the external influence in the society will be possible (e.g., implementing SDGs key aspects such as gender quality, reduce waste reduction and energy consumption). For this to be a reality, different communication methods with students are needed (e.g., different student academic levels). Nevertheless, critical challenges need to be tackled in the institutions inside and outside the institution environment, such as incorporating sustainability principles, political environment and stakeholders' interest.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Mindset,327
10.1002/ejsp.3039,Do mindsets shape intentions to help those in need? Unravelling the paradoxical effects of mindsets of poverty on helping intentions,,"Abstract Poverty remains a pressing problem, with social support playing a crucial role in its reduction. Drawing on previous research on health‐related mindsets, we propose that a growth mindset of poverty – that is, believing poverty can be changed – can have both positive and negative effects on helping intentions through increased outcome expectancy and blame, respectively. In three experiments, we found that a growth mindset of poverty is associated with increased outcome expectancy and blame, which, in parallel, mediate the relationship between mindsets and helping intentions. However, these contrary indirect effects negate each other, yielding a total null effect. Further, manipulating the relationship between mindset and outcome expectancy (but not blame) alters the relationship between mindset and helping intentions (Studies 2 and 3). By shedding light on the circumstances under which mindsets of poverty can diminish or amplify helping intentions, our research offers valuable insights for practitioners and charities dedicated to combating poverty.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Mindset,1

10.1002/pop4.283,The Liability of Poorness: Why the Playing Field is Not Level for Poverty Entrepreneurs,,"Entrepreneurship is increasingly emphasized as a pathway out of poverty. However, the complex, multi‐faceted nature of the poverty experience has important implications for the ability to launch and sustain viable businesses. All entrepreneurs must overcome the liabilities of newness and smallness, as reflected in a lack of legitimacy with stakeholders, inadequate resources and capabilities, an unclear identity, misunderstood roles and unclear role definitions, few established routines and procedures, and little bargaining power. However, poverty entrepreneurs face an additional barrier, which we term the liability of poorness. Four underlying dimensions of the liability of poorness are identified: literacy shortcomings, a scarcity mindset, significant non‐business distractions, and the lack of financial slack or a safety net. The manner in which each of these interacting elements exacerbate the entrepreneur's ability to address the liabilities of newness and smallness is explored. It is argued that, as the liability of poorness becomes greater, the vulnerability and fragility of the poverty entrepreneur's venture are apt to increase. Under such circumstances, significant external shocks and unexpected occurrences, such as the economic shutdown resulting from the COVID‐19 pandemic, typically have a more devastating impact on the ventures of the poor.

The objective is to motivate business and national leaders to do so with sustainability mindsets and strategic leadership. The pre‐conditions that will accelerate the “motivation” to do so are identified, as are interventions identified. The sphere of influence business and national leaders have to impact sustainable globalization is identified. Design/methodology/approach The approach is to focus on information in the public domain that outlines the “real” challenges faced by nations and business as they consider the need for sustainability and key issues such as “poverty and climate change”, which if not addressed could have detrimental strategic implications for the planet, business and nations. The changes that have taken place since 1982 when global leaders signed up to Agenda 21 and the relatively insignificant movement that has occurred to date is outlined to strengthen the case for quantum leaps in the short to medium term. The strategic framework recommended is one that combines the need for organizations to set a new gold standard for “corporate responsibility”, which is a “commitment to sustainable business” followed by a commitment to differentiating the business or nation on a sustainability paradigm. This is presented as means to embedding sustainability in strategy in the form of the concept of “strategic corporate sustainability”. The concept of strategic corporate sustainability is presented as a two‐step approach that initially requires both national and corporate leaders to commit to the need for sustainability by developing triple bottom line strategies. This is followed by the need to embed sustainability strategy as the corporate strategy that differentiates the nation and the business, strategically setting it apart from those that have not done so. This is presented as one of the ways to move forward to achieve the goal of sustainable globalization. Findings The key findings from information in the public domain of nations and business that have embedded a sustainability policy and are demonstrating that enlightened leaders who have sustainability mindsets as a primary requirement for the future are presented with the examples of General Electric and Unilever. The process of nations embedding sustainability policy, which in turn motivates business to strive for sustainable business, which finally leads to sustainable consumption, is presented in a sequential manner.

Driven by the 'poverty' mindset, physical measures such as minimal paving, public water posts and community latrines actually brand the slums apart instead of assimilating them into the urban infrastructure fabric. The concept of Slum Networking proposes comprehensive water and environmental sanitation infrastructure as the central and catalytic leverage for holistic development. At costs less than the conventional 'slum' solutions, it tries to penetrate a high quality urban infrastructure net deeply into the slums to assimilate them into the city rather than lock them in as disadvantaged islands. Further, it transcends resource barriers and 'aid' through innovative partnerships and the latent resource mobilisation potential of the so-called 'poor'. This paper examines Slum Networking as implemented in Sanjaynagar in Ahmedabad, India and compares it with a similar settlement with no interventions in Ahmedabad.

Also, recruiting local youth workers, developing authentic partnerships, and creating a non-judgemental environment delivered a positive 'ripple effect' beyond that possible from class-blind sport provision. However, 'win win' rhetoric ignores stresses from meeting financial requirements and moral dilemmas from trade-offs between social and business goals. The organisation's 'non-establishment' nature is partially undermined by emphasising local poverty of aspiration and the psychological thinking within Dweck's 'Growth Mindset' and Duckworth's 'Grit' research. The resulting focus on individual effort and learning from failure chimes with neoliberal thinking, ignoring how widening societal inequality and politics causes local problems and the need for structural changes for wider social impact.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Mindset,26

10.1108/ajems-08-2016-0120,Entrepreneurship education research in Nigeria: current foci and future research agendas,,"Purpose Entrepreneurship education plays a crucial role in the development of entrepreneurs and the enhancement of entrepreneurial activities in every economy. This paper presents the findings of a review of Nigerian entrepreneurship education literature published in 20 journals over a 16-year period. The purpose of this paper is to examine research contributions in the field of entrepreneurship education within the Nigerian context, with the aim of understanding the focus and the different research areas covered by researchers in this area, and to make suggestions that can guide scholars in their future research contributions. Design/methodology/approach Systematic literature reviews are recognized methods for conducting evidence-based research. The study adopted a systematic literature review approach, drawing from a computerized search of five selected databases, using predetermined key words by the researchers. Findings The main finding of this paper is that related concepts like skills, intention, drive and attitude have been used in expounding discussions on the outcome of entrepreneurship education, but very little has been written on entrepreneurial mindset, which other studies have suggested is a crucial point in the journey of an entrepreneur (Reed and Stoltz, 2011; Neneh, 2012). Furthermore, learning and teaching of entrepreneurship in the Nigerian higher education institutions seem to be more focused on creating awareness about entrepreneurship, as against the experiential approach that scholars have argued to be a prerequisite for developing the next generation of entrepreneurs (Bell, 2015). The study also found that over 80 percent of the reviewed articles are published in journals not ranked or indexed in the ABS journal rankings or the Scopus database. Research limitations/implications The paper is limited since it is based on a review of literature from a selected range of databases, covering a specific time span. This potentially excludes other studies outside this time span. Scholarship in this area and context will benefit greatly when researchers target, choose and engage the higher ranked and more impactful journals as the outlet for their research outputs. Practical implications At a time when efforts are being made to address socioeconomic issues like poverty and unemployment through mainstream training in entrepreneurship education, this paper provides a better understanding of the state of research in this context, by highlighting the potential gaps as to where research investigation is needed for better policy formulation and guiding future research. Originality/value There are limited studies that focus on the issue of entrepreneurial mindset in entrepreneurship education in Nigeria. Overall, this paper identifies an important gap in the literature that warrants future research.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Mindset,27
10.1108/ijif-12-2018-0138,Venture waqf in a circular economy,,"Purpose This paper aims to enhance the impact of incorporated waqf institutions by blending their resources to promote responsible small businesses that are inclusive of human development, service to society and preservation of ecological environment and other species. This is expected to shift the paradigm of businesses from the current waste-oriented linear economy to ideally a zero-waste circular economy. Design/methodology/approach This is an analytical study building on the experience of European Venture Philanthropy Organizations (VPOs) that work with the primary objective of making impactful businesses successful, with capital protection and return on investment being of secondary concern. This paper suggests an incorporated institutional design that blends resources for promoting responsible businesses using a new hybrid financial mechanism, namely, equity-at-default (EaD) to replace collateral and foreclosure requirements with responsibility and compassion. Findings The research calls for changing the business paradigm from linear to circular, an incorporated institutional framework for venture waqf, purpose of the waqf to make impactful small businesses successful and designing a financial contract to loan in favor of responsible businesses that convert to equity stake for the waqf in case of default (EaD) replacing collateral and foreclosure requirements. Research limitations/implications This is a theoretical study motivated by the success of VPOs but assigns a new role to waqf institutions. Furthermore, the incorporated nature of waqf is a new idea and EaD is a new mechanism. Being new, these ideas have the risk of not being implemented. However, the broader message that waqf shall promote businesses that are inclusive of ecological concerns is generally applicable. Practical implications The paper has a significant practical implication to transform the responsibility and consciousness of businesses. Waqf is fundamentally a compassionate institution, and it must enhance the responsibility of businesses to become more inclusive of the environment and other species. It should also become more compassionate toward businesses that are in distress and default. In this sense, the paper tries to internalize compassion in financial contracting that can potentially change the architecture of lending. Social implications Altering businesses’ mindset from a waste-driven extractive linear economy to inclusive circular economy has a tremendous transformative role. This will have implications for enhancing business consciousness and responsibility. As poverty is a phenomenon of state of mind, changing the society’s state of thought in Muslim communities is expected to have basic positive implications. Entrepreneurs with a new mindset can have far-reaching positive impacts on the society. Originality/value The paper offers potentially innovative perspectives in four key areas and blends the different resources in an incorporated waqf that makes responsible entrepreneurs assume a partnership role in times of distress through EaD. Furthermore, the integration of compassion in financial contracting could have better implications for return on investment as well. The ideal state of an economy is where waste is turned into wealth and well-being is something that all policymakers must keep on the top of their agendas.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Mindset,30
10.1080/13691058.2018.1562092,Scarcity mindset in reproductive health decision making: a qualitative study from rural Malawi,,"Poverty has widespread impacts on health. In dealing with resource scarcity, individuals' thoughts are narrowed to address immediate resource limitations, thus crowding out other information, a phenomenon called the scarcity mindset. To assess for indication of a scarcity mindset in sexual and reproductive decision making in rural Malawi, a setting with extreme resource scarcity, we collected qualitative data in the form of eight focus group discussions and 28 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with women and men of varying ages and marital status. Participants, who were of low socioeconomic status, described constant tradeoffs that they made to secure their daily needs. They articulated both the challenges of supporting many children and the need to bear many children to guarantee their own future support. While participants described wealthy people as being concerned with preserving resources (often through the practice of limiting childbearing), they described poor people as working to increase their probability of success against an uncertain economic future (without due consideration of contraceptive behaviours). We found qualitative evidence that a scarcity mindset may influence reproductive decision making among women and men in rural Malawi and may preclude the use of contraception in low-resource settings.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Mindset,8
10.1177/1470595811413110,Cross-cultural conflict and affirmative action: Inter- and intra-ethnic dilemmas of Malaysia’s heterogeneous workplace,,"This article, a combination of field research report and literature review, looks at affirmative-action policies both as a mechanism for managing cross-cultural conflict and as creator of other types of conflicts in multi-ethnic Malaysia. Socioeconomic imbalances and post-independence rioting prompted the implementation of these policies to reduce ethnic confrontations and uplift the majority Bumiputras. They were reluctantly accepted by the minority immigrant communities, but managed to change Malaysia’s pre-independence ethnic disparities. The article identifies some of the cross-cultural conflicts the nation still faces, after four decades of affirmative action: (a) the existence of a highly segregated educational system with little opportunity for intercultural interactions; (b) the ghost of latent inter-ethnic tensions beneath the surface; (c) the accentuation of intra-ethnic disparities; (d) complaints about alleged Malay cultural hegemony and Chinese economic hegemony; (e) the visible marginalization of ethnic Indians due to alleged discrimination; (f) the formation of ethnic enclaves in the market; (g) fierce debate about the effects of the affirmative policies; and (h) some challenging by-products of ethno-politics. It also identifies some of the positive factors that work in favor of a better management of these cross-cultural conflicts: (a) the capacity of the country to withstand the changing winds of the global economy; (b) the relative stability of the societal balance produced by the affirmative economic policies since 1970; (c) the reduction of poverty as a direct result of affirmative action; (d) the accentuation of the Malaysian character of the nation among new generations of immigrants; (e) the promise of formal programs to promote national unity; and (f) contemporary trends that promise mindset changes.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Mindset,25

Engineers interested in contributing to the SDGs need to be able to understand not only each goal in depth but also their integrated nature. This paper first emphasizes the importance of: (i) incorporating the SDGs in engineering education; (ii) making engineers aware of their contribution to the SDGs; and (iii) encouraging them to embrace a new systems-thinking mindset to understand how SDGs interact in an integrated manner. The second part of this paper proposes an engineering analytical cross-impact analysis approach to quantify the interactions among the SDGs and organize and prioritize the goals that could most impact the others. Our analysis shows that focusing on SDGs 4 (Education), 6 (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene), 7 (Energy), 11 (Cities) but especially 12 (Consumption), 16 (Governance), and 17 (Partnerships) will influence the other goals and aid in their success. It was also found that focusing on eliminating poverty (SDG 1), counter-intuitively, worsens poverty, since it inhibits the other goals on which poverty depends.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Mindset,12

The researchers are of the view that these two factors in Zimbabwe need to be addressed in tandem if the battle against poverty and HIV/AIDS will ever be won. This paper, through a review of literature, aims to explore the relationship between poverty and HIV/AIDS. Findings indicate that the two phenomena bear an inextricable relationship, with both, mutually and reciprocatively reinforcing one another. The following dynamics, directly or indirectly influence the two concepts: patriarchy; phenomenon of bride price; female-headed households; gender inequality; poverty; and traditional practices. The paper recommends the following to address the two concepts: diluting cultures and patriarchal forces; changing mindset on gender roles; affirmative action to empower women; mainstreaming gender neutral education; zero tolerance against sexual violence; and women's economic empowerment.

10.1186/1472-698x-9-5,Stakeholder perceptions of mental health stigma and poverty in Uganda,,"World wide, there is plentiful evidence regarding the role of stigma in mental illness, as well as the association between poverty and mental illness. The experiences of stigma catalyzed by poverty revolve around experiences of devaluation, exclusion, and disadvantage. Although the relationship between poverty, stigma and mental illness has been documented in high income countries, little has been written on this relationship in low and middle income countries.The paper describes the opinions of a range of mental health stakeholders regarding poverty, stigma, mental illness and their relationship in the Ugandan context, as part of a wider study, aimed at exploring policy interventions required to address the vicious cycle of mental ill-health and poverty.Semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with purposefully selected mental health stakeholders from various sectors. The interviews and FGDs were audio-recorded, and transcriptions were coded on the basis of a pre-determined coding frame. Thematic analysis of the data was conducted using NVivo7, adopting a framework analysis approach.Most participants identified a reciprocal relationship between poverty and mental illness. The stigma attached to mental illness was perceived as a common phenomenon, mostly associated with local belief systems regarding the causes of mental illness. Stigma associated with both poverty and mental illness serves to reinforce the vicious cycle of poverty and mental ill-health. Most participants emphasized a relationship between poverty and internalized stigma among people with mental illness in Uganda.According to a range of mental health stakeholders in Uganda, there is a strong interrelationship between poverty, stigma and mental illness. These findings re-affirm the need to recognize material resources as a central element in the fight against stigma of mental illness, and the importance of stigma reduction programmes in protecting the mentally ill from social isolation, particularly in conditions of poverty.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Internalized stigma,95

In a combined sample of low-income women (N = 210), we tested a dual-pathway model to explain how these perceived stigma dimensions are related to depression among the impoverished. We proposed that interpersonal (i.e., impaired support availability and heightened fear of support request rejection) and intrapersonal factors (i.e., impaired self-esteem) differentially mediate the relationship of internalized and experienced poverty stigma with depression. Structural equation modeling partially supported the model: internalized stigma and depression were partially mediated by self-esteem and fear of rejection, while experienced stigma was related to depression through fear of rejection only. In other words, internalized and experienced perceived stigma activate separate and similar mechanisms to influence depression among the poor.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Internalized stigma,119

This article draws on repeated qualitative interviews (conducted every 6 months over a period of 3 years) with 44 formerly incarcerated individuals, to understand how these individuals experience the search for a home after their prison release. The interviews show that the quest for a home is central to participants’ reintegration projects as they seek to establish themselves as ‘decent’ and economically self-sufficient citizens, and shed stigmatized identities associated with incarceration, poverty, homelessness, and place. Interviews also suggest that their quest for a home is an arduous one as they encounter numerous barriers to housing arising from both structural and interpersonal forms of incarceration stigma. Somewhat paradoxically, the challenges that they face in accessing housing seem to hinder their ability to shed the stigmatized identities associated with their incarceration. Ultimately, the narratives presented here show how stigma can restrict access to a valuable material and symbolic resource (housing), resulting in ongoing stigmatization, and contributing to the enduring and discrediting mark of incarceration. In this way, the study illustrates how stigma that is enacted by both individuals and the state, that is embodied in place, and that is internalized and managed by stigmatized individuals themselves, can work to reproduce power and serve as justification for inequality.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Internalized stigma,139

Emotional distress is among the more common factors associated with HIV treatment adherence. Typical barriers to adherence may be overshadowed by poverty experiences in the most disadvantaged populations of people living with HIV/AIDS, such as people with lower-literacy skills. Methods: One hundred eighty-eight men and women living with HIV/AIDS who demonstrated poor health literacy completed measures of social and health-related stress, indicators of extreme poverty, as well as other factors associated with nonadherence. HIV treatment adherence was monitored prospectively, using unannounced pill counts. Results: Two-thirds of the sample demonstrated adherence <85% of pills taken. Multivariable analyses showed that food insufficiency and hunger predicted antiretroviral therapy nonadherence over and above depression, internalized stigma, substance use, and HIV-related social stressors. Conclusions: Interventions for HIV treatment nonadherence with the most socially disadvantaged persons in developed countries should be reconceptualized to directly address poverty, especially food insufficiency and hunger, as both a moral and public health imperative.

Based on the narratives and observations ofpeople living in colony and street settings, I trace three destructive processes by which the social stigmata of leprosy become physically expressed. First, strategies of concealment further the progression and spread of HD through late detection and undertreatment. Second, the internalization of stigma can lead to bodily dissociation and injury through self-neglect. Finally, some people intentionally seek injuries under conditions of desperate poverty.

Based upon interviews with 36 women conducted in 1997, one year after the passage of the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, the paper compares women living in concentrated poverty in the inner cities with those living in rural and suburban communities. The levels of stigma vary dramatically between the two areas, with women in mixed class communities experiencing much more negative treatment and internalizing the punitive welfare discourse to a far greater extent. Women experiencing lower levels of welfare stigma are able to enact more resistive practices to counter the effects of the dominant discourse.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Internalized stigma,52

As a result, perinatally infected youth are increasingly able to reach adolescence. There is limited information about the psychosocial challenges facing adolescents living with HIV (ALWH) in rural settings of sub-Saharan Africa. We sought to understand psychosocial challenges facing ALWH in rural Uganda and their effects on mental health and HIV treatment outcomes. We conducted 5 focus group discussions and 40 one-on-one in-depth interviews in Mbarara, Uganda with adolescents (aged 13–17 years) and adult women caregivers. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed directly into English, and coded using thematic analysis to identify themes related to psychosocial adversities and mental health. Adversities faced by adolescents included negative community perceptions (perceived aggression, presumed early mortality), HIV stigma (enacted and internalized), vulnerability factors (loss of parents, poverty), and health challenges (depression, ART non-adherence). In the conceptual model that emerged from the findings, negative community perceptions (about perceived aggression or presumed early mortality) predisposed ALWH to experience enactments and internalization of stigma that led to depression and ART non-adherence. The data also identified several protective factors, including counselling, family and religious support, and timely serostatus disclosure. Interventions to correct community misperceptions about HIV can potentially reduce stigma and thereby improve physical and mental health outcomes of ALWH.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Internalized stigma,62
10.1002/casp.892,Reframing applied disease stigma research: a multilevel analysis of diabetes stigma in Ghana,,"Abstract Research suggests that rural and urban Ghanaians living with uncontrolled diabetes—typified by extreme weight loss—experience HIV/AIDS‐related stigma. This paper reports a multilevel analysis of this stigma within the broader context of diabetes handicap in two rural communities. Two key findings emerge. First, the content of stigma constitutes social representations of HIV/AIDS, and to internalized and projected collective attributions of protracted illness to witchcraft or sorcery. Thus the stigma experienced by people with uncontrolled diabetes is not specific to the disease category ‘diabetes’ and distant others affected by it. Second, extreme biophysical disruption, which precipitates misperceptions, stigma and/or discrimination, is both cause and consequence of financial destitution and psychosocial neglect. Both forms of handicap have deeper pre‐stigma roots in poverty and the socio‐psychological and cultural impact of long‐term illness. Thus the actuality or threat of diabetes stigma has to be understood in terms of diabetes handicap, which in turn has to be understood as a product of shared responses to long‐term illness in communities constantly negotiating financial, health and psychological insecurities. The scope for multifaceted/multilevel intervention is considered taking into account the biophysical and psychological impact of illness and the socio‐psychological and structural realities of diabetes care in Ghana.

We sought to deepen understanding of the barriers to care engagement at three critical steps of the care cascade proposed to make greatest impact for attaining the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets aimed at shutting down the HIV epidemic. Methods Analyses were conducted among HIV-infected adults in rural East Africa. Qualitative data were collected using in-depth interviews among 63 individuals participating in an ongoing test-and treat trial (NCT01864683) in its baseline year (July 2013-June 2014). Audio recordings were transcribed, translated into English, and coded using Atlas.ti software. Data were analyzed using a thematic framework for explaining barriers to care engagement that drew upon both theory and prior empirical research in similar settings. Results Multiple barriers to engagement in care were observed. HIV-related stigma across dimensions of anticipated, internalized and enacted stigma manifested in denial and fears of disclosure, and influenced lapses in care engagement across multiple steps in the cascade. Poverty (lack of food and transport), lack of social support, work interference, prior negative experiences with health services, drug side effects, and treatment fatigue also negatively affected ART adherence and viral suppression. Gender differences were observed, with work interference and denial disproportionately affecting men compared to women. Conclusion Multiple barriers to HIV care engagement still pervade rural sub-Saharan settings threatening the realization of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. To control the epidemic, efforts need to be accelerated to combat stigma. Patient economic empowerment, innovative drug formulations, as well as more patient-responsive health systems, may help overcome barriers to engagement in care.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Internalized stigma,64

Reflected appraisals and social rejection, in turn, reinforce delinquency. In the context of severely disadvantaged inner‐city communities—where arrests have become a normal and expected ritual of male adolescence, and official labelers and labels have less legitimacy—the alleged preconditions for a “labeling” effect of an arrest are generally not met. Retrospective, personal interviews with 20 minority youth (aged 18–20) from high‐poverty urban neighborhoods, who experienced at least one juvenile arrest, suggest that juvenile arrests typically carry little stigma and do little discernible harm to self‐concept or social relationships. Micro‐level labeling theory is an inadequate framework to understand the social impact of mass criminal justice intervention in inner‐city communities. Whereas the individual social psychological impact of the official labeling process has weakened, the mass criminalization of inner‐city African‐American youth has exacted collective costs in terms of social exclusion and diminished social expectations.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Internalized stigma,62

In Latin America and the Caribbean, structural factors such as poverty, stigma, and inequality disproportionately affect women and may fuel both the HIV epidemic and food insecurity. Methods We examined factors contributing to food insecurity among women living with HIV (WLHIV) in the Dominican Republic (DR). Data collection included in-depth, semi-structured interviews in 2013 with 30 WLHIV with indications of food insecurity who resided in urban or peri-urban areas and were recruited from local HIV clinics. In-person interviews were conducted in Spanish. Transcripts were coded using content analysis methods and an inductive approach to identify principal and emergent themes. Results Respondents identified economic instability as the primary driver of food insecurity, precipitated by enacted stigma in the labor and social domains. Women described experiences of HIV-related labor discrimination in formal and informal sectors. Women commonly reported illegal HIV testing by employers, and subsequent dismissal if HIV-positive, especially in tourism and free trade zones. Enacted stigma in the social domain manifested as gossip and rejection by family, friends, and neighbors and physical, verbal, and sexual abuse by intimate partners, distancing women from sources of economic and food support. These experiences with discrimination and abuse contributed to internalized stigma among respondents who, as a result, were fearful and hesitant to disclose their HIV status; some participants reported leaving spouses and/or families, resulting in further isolation from economic resources, food and other support. A minority of participants described social support by friends, spouses, families and support groups, which helped to ameliorate food insecurity and emotional distress. Conclusions Addressing food insecurity among WLHIV requires policy and programmatic interventions to enforce existing laws designed to protect the rights of people living with HIV, reduce HIV-related stigma, and improve gender equality.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Internalized stigma,41

We address two marginalized populations at elevated risk of acquiring HIV: women who are married to men who also have sex with men (MSM) and wives of injection drug users (IDUs).We used a combination of focus groups (qualitative) and structured surveys (quantitative) to identify the risks that high-risk men pose to their low-risk wives and/or sexual partners. Married MSM were identified using respondent-driven recruitment in Tamil Nadu, India, and were interviewed by trainer assessors. A sample of wives of injection drug users in Chennai were recruited from men enrolled in a cohort study of the epidemiology of drug use among IDUs in Chennai, and completed a face-to-face survey. Focus groups were held with all groups of study participants, and the outcomes transcribed and analyzed for major themes on family, HIV and issues related to stigma, discrimination and disclosure.Using mixed-methods research, married MSM are shown to not disclose their sexual practices to their wives, whether due to internalized homophobia, fear of stigma and discrimination, personal embarrassment or changing sexual mores. Married MSM in India largely follow the prevailing norm of marriage to the opposite sex and having a child to satisfy social pressures. Male IDUs cannot hide their drug use as easily as married MSM, but they also avoid disclosure. The majority of their wives learn of their drug-using behaviour only after they are married, making them generally helpless to protect themselves. Fear of poverty and negative influences on children were the major impacts associated with continuing drug use.We propose a research and prevention agenda to address the HIV risks encountered by families of high-risk men in the Indian and other low- and middle-income country contexts.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Internalized stigma,79
10.1111/1468-2427.12626,"The Power of Group Stigmatization: Wealthy Roma, Urban Space and Strategies of Defence in Post‐socialist Romania",,"Abstract Recent research on Roma stigmatization has tended to focus on the marginal socio‐economic and spatial position of Roma people within European societies, with poverty, persistent inequalities and substandard housing conditions (for example, ghettoization) highlighting their differential treatment. Central to such accounts are group images and stereotypes of Roma as ‘benefit scroungers’ and/or ‘beggars’ lacking notions of self‐restraint and social responsibility. This body of research is hugely important in terms of its contribution to an understanding of the complex dynamics of marginalization and stigmatization of poor Roma households. Yet not all Roma are characterized by poverty and economic hardship. This article explores the neglected experiences of wealthy Roma within urban spaces in Romania. It draws on empirical evidence from interviews with Roma families, leaders and local authorities. Our analysis exposes the way in which Roma are vehemently stigmatized regardless of their economic position or housing circumstances and highlights deep underlying sentiments towards them within Romanian society. We critique Wacquant's concept of territorial stigmatization by applying it to wealthy groups outwith typical areas of relegation (for example, Roma ghettos) within the specific urban context of post‐socialist Romania. While our analysis points to the internalization of stigma, we also identify distinct defensive strategies wealthy Roma employ to counter and avoid stigmatization. We suggest that a focus on the neglected spaces of wealthy Roma groups can facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of the distinct urban power relations that shape Roma stigmatization, reveal how this long‐term process has recently been accentuated within Europe alongside a more overt populist and anti‐Roma political agenda, and contribute to the development and refinement of Wacquant's thesis.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Internalized stigma,40
10.1111/josi.12213,"Issue Introduction: Identity Concealment: Multilevel Predictors, Moderators, and Consequences",,"Over the past 20 years, research on the experiences of people who are targeted by prejudice and discrimination has grown dramatically (for reviews see Major & O'Brien, 2005; Puhl & Heuer, 2009; Pascoe & Smart Richman, 2009). This research has shown the power of stigma to affect many life outcomes including psychological distress, physical health, and academic achievement (e.g., Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, & Link, 2013; Steele, Spencer, & Aronson, 2002). The bulk of the research, however, has focused on visible stigmatized identities, primarily race and gender. In the current issue, we focus on stigmatized identities that can be concealed. Concealable stigmatized identities are socially stigmatized identities that have the potential to be hidden from others. Some examples include minority sexual orientation, history of mental illness, chronic illness, substance abuse, and a criminal record. Previous work has shown that people with concealable stigmatized identities experience many of the same negative outcomes as people with visible identities, despite the fact that the stigmatized identity can be kept secret. For example, adolescents with minority sexual orientation have higher rates of suicidality and depression compared to their heterosexual peers (Marshal et al., 2011); people with a history of depression have higher incidence of cardiovascular disease than those without depression (Bradley & Rumfeld, 2015); students with a history of mental illness who attend college are less likely to graduate than those without a mental illness history (Kessler, Foster, Saunders, & Stang, 1995). Thus, concealable stigmatized identities are similar to visible stigmatized identities in terms of social devaluation and negative consequences, but there are questions remaining about (1) when and why people conceal versus disclose and (2) what the effects of concealment are on social and health outcomes. Arguably, people with concealed stigmatized identities could avoid discrimination by keeping their identities concealed and thus the pathway from stigma to negative outcomes would be less likely to be a direct result of experiencing discrimination as it is with visible identities (e.g., Pascoe & Smart Richman, 2009; Williams & Mohammed, 2009). Yet, the act of keeping an identity concealed may bring its own burdens that are unrelated to directly experiencing discrimination but have similar negative effects on psychological and physical health (Pachankis, 2007). Although theoretical models of how concealment and disclosure might affect health and how people may make disclosure decisions exist (e.g., Chaudoir & Fisher, 2010; Pachankis, 2007; Quinn & Earnshaw, 2011; Ragins, 2008), relatively little empirical research has explored the myriad factors that lead people to decide to conceal or reveal their identities and what the consequences are of these decisions. In the current issue, we seek to integrate research across many different concealable identities to examine both the causes and consequences of identity concealment. We sought research from multiple perspectives. The authors in the current issue reside within different research specialties and frameworks, including clinical and social psychology, management and organizational studies, and public health. The issue is organized to move from examining the causes, or antecedents, of concealment to looking at the consequences. The articles in this issue present a multilevel approach to antecedents of concealment, examining contextual variables at different levels of an ecological system (e.g., structural factors, interpersonal factors) and how these interact with intra-individual factors to influence concealment and disclosure decisions. With respect to consequences, a contribution of the current issue is to explore in a nuanced and honest way, the tension between individual- and social- level benefits and drawbacks of concealment. Taken together, we believe the articles in this issue will prove both thought-provoking to those interested in the question of when and why people keep identities concealed and policy relevant to those interested in changing the factors that might force some to keep concealed and wary of the consequences upon disclosure. In the following section, we state our objectives and briefly discuss the main point of each article, showing how the articles fit together into the issue and the broader literature. We also highlight the diversity of article types and identities included, which we view as a strength of the current issue, while acknowledging that causes and consequences may vary to some degree across concealable stigmatized identities. Work on social stigma tends to focus on the individual and has been criticized for not taking a broader view (Link & Phelan, 2001). Whereas individual beliefs are important aspects of concealment, in the current issue we hope to push the field forward to think more about how organizations and relationships shape the experience of concealment and disclosure—and how these variables can be captured in research. People with concealed identities are embedded in contexts that lead them to make decisions about whether to keep their identities concealed or revealed. As is clear across the research presented in this issue, the antecedents to concealing or revealing a stigmatized identity are complex and there is an interaction between the environment and individual beliefs. The articles in the first section of the issue demonstrate this complexity. The articles are organized such that they move from more distal structural factors (policies, institutional norms), though interpersonal (relational) factors, to intrapersonal (individual) factors (Cook, Purdie-Vaughns, Meyer, & Busch, 2014). In the first article, Wessel's (2017) research focuses on predicting when a lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) person might disclose their sexual orientation to specific coworkers within their workplace. Using multilevel modeling, she examines the effects of a network of coworkers—including ratings of the least and most supportive coworkers—as well the written LGB-supportive organizational policies at a workplace on disclosure. She finds that both the maximum support of coworkers and more supportive organizational policies predict disclosure—even to nonsupportive coworkers. She finds that the importance of organizational support is quite strong above and beyond individual relationships and perceptions. Thus, disclosure is most strongly predicted by supportive institutional policies. The second article, by Lyons, Zatzick, Thompson, and Bushe (2017), also comes from a management and organizational perspective. A theoretical framework of identity disclosure (more broadly) within workplace environments is presented with a focus on how organizational expectations such as differing between a market logics focus (i.e., all that matters is the output and performance) versus a supportive expression focus (i.e., maintaining positivity and engagement of the workers) can lead workers to be more or less likely to conceal identities within the workplace in order to match organizational expectancies. These two articles focus on different structural and relational aspects of organizations that can steer a person with a concealed identity to feel that concealing the identity may be the safer path. They also highlight the intersection of organizational policy with relationships with coworkers. The third article, by Iwelunmor, Sofolahan-Oladeinde, Nwaozuru, Conserve, and Airhihenbuwa (2017), tackles a very different social environment: the role of family relationships and identities in the decision to disclose HIV positive status among women. Narratives were collected in Nigeria where the importance of family and social ties is high. Using focus groups, in-depth interviewing, and free-listing, Iwelunmor et al. found that HIV testing and management of the disease was considered a ""family burden"" that influenced decision making on disclosure. Disclosing also disrupted women's views of themselves as well as their place in the family. The idea of an identity as shared within the family rather than solely of the individual gives a different perspective on what it means to conceal and opens new avenues on how to intervene in the decision-making processes. It may also steer research on interventions towards more dyadic or group based causes of concealment. The next article, by Ryan, Legate, Weinstein, and Rahman (2017), focuses on an interaction between relationship processes—perceived autonomy and support within specific relationships, including with friends, family, and coworkers—and the individual-level belief of internalized homophobia to predict disclosure of sexual orientation to specific partners. Results showed that people were aware of who in their lives was most supportive and chose to selectively disclose to them. This effect was particularly strong when a person was high in internalized homophobia. This work extends the small extant literature showing that people are relatively good at picking supportive confidants to whom to disclose (e.g., Chaudoir & Quinn, 2010; Sylaska & Ewards, 2014) and begins to show the process of how people choose confidants. In the final article in the first section, Overstreet, Gaskins, Quinn, and Williams (2017), examined two individual-level variables for predicting the extent to which people with experiences of physical intimate partner violence (IPV) disclose those experiences to others. They found that there was an interaction between internalization of the negative stereotypes about IPV and how central the IPV was to their identities. People with high levels of internalized IPV stigma were less likely to disclose overall. However, for people with low levels of internalized IPV stigma, the importance of the identity predicted disclosure: the more central the identity, the more people disclosed their experiences of violence to others. In both the Ryan et al. and the Overstreet et al. articles, researchers include one of the most studied variables in stigma research: internalized stigma (also labeled internalized homophobia or homonegativity when working with minority sexual orientation). In previous research this variable has been shown to predict lower self-esteem and more psychological distress across many different concealable identities, including HIV AIDS (Lee, Kochman, & Sikkema, 2002), mental illness (Livingston & Boyd, 2010), and minority sexual orientation (Herek, Cogan, & Gillis, 2002), but much less work has focused on its role in concealment. These two articles add to the field by not only looking at the relationship between internalized stigma and disclosure, but also examining its interaction with other variables. Both are showing that people with high levels of internalized stigma are especially cautious at revealing their identities to others and may require extra assurance and support from others before being willing to confide. In summary, the first section of this issue brings into focus the host of antecedents for concealing versus disclosing a stigmatized identity. Together, the articles highlight a multilevel perspective in showing that organizational policies and expectances, familial and cultural norms, relationships process, and individual beliefs work together to influence a person's choice to disclose to others or keep an identity concealed. Implicit in this work is that people with concealed identities are calibrating their disclosures to the relative backlash or support they expect to receive. In the second section, the issue moves from the causes to the consequences of concealment. The ramifications of revealing a stigmatized identity can be difficult to predict. On the one hand, the reason people keep an identity concealed is to shield themselves from the devaluation and discrimination that they believe will come from others if the identity is known (Goffman, 1963; Link, 1987). Thus, concealment may have positive consequences. On the other hand, keeping an important identity concealed from others may lead people to feel less authentic, establish fewer close ties with others (Beals, Peplau, & Gable, 2009), and be a cognitive burden (Smart & Wegner, 2000). Thus, disclosure decisions are complex and can have both positive and negative consequences (Goldberg, Killen, & O'Day, 2005). As one example of this complexity in the literature, a provocative study published in Cole, Kemeny, Taylor, Visscher, and Fahey (1996) found that concealing sexual orientation was related to accelerated progression of HIV in gay men. The next year, however, using the same data set (Cole, Kemeny, & Taylor, 1997), the researchers found that for men who were high in rejection-sensitivity, concealment of their sexual orientation protected them from accelerated HIV progression and time to AIDS diagnosis. Thus, concealment had both negative and positive effects on health depending on a personality variable. Surprisingly few studies have been conducted examining the ramifications of concealment (for a recent review on concealment and health consequences, see Quinn, in press). This may, in part, be due to the difficulty of capturing effects over time. In the current issue we hope to begin to fill this gap in the literature with examination of concealment effects across a variety of different identities, including sexual orientation, criminal offender status, chronic physical illness, and mental illness. Two of the studies are also longitudinal, allowing a much stronger test for the effects of stigma and concealment, and helping to show a more causal path than is possible with cross-sectional data. In the first article in this section, Moore and Tangney (2017) focus on a group that is stigmatized, frequently concealed, and rarely studied in the stigma literature—criminal offenders. Keeping one's status as a criminal offender secret after release from jail is possible, but in order to do so one would need to stay socially isolated. Applying for jobs and housing requires disclosing one's criminal background. Thus, engaging with the broader community requires disclosure. Moore and Tangney present longitudinal results with a sample of criminal offenders in the United States showing that their anticipation of stigma (measured before release from jail) predicted their postrelease behaviors 3 months later. Offenders who anticipated more stigma at postrelease exhibited more social withdrawal and isolation which, in turn, predicted more mental health problems 1 year postrelease. This study is remarkable because criminal offenders are so rarely studied as a stigmatized group, but also because it is one of the first to show the process by which stigma can lead to more social isolation, which in turn predicts worse mental health and lowered community involvement. In addition, these results are affected by the race of the offenders. White offenders show the above pattern much more strongly and consistently than African American offenders. Using a longitudinal design allowed for insight into both the antecedents and consequences of remaining social isolated, and, thereby largely concealed from others. In the next article, Newheiser, Barreto, and Tiemersma (2017) note that most of the work examining concealing or revealing a stigmatized identity in the workplace is correlational. Thus, in order to take a more experimental approach, they recruited a sample of lesbian, gay, and bisexual Dutch participants and asked them to recall and describe a time when they either concealed or revealed their sexual orientation at work. They found that participants who recalled hiding their sexual orientation at work reported lower feelings of belonging in their workplace and lower job satisfaction, as well as more negative affect and self-esteem. These finding were replicated in a second study that included participants with three different concealed stigmatized identities (LGBT, mental illness, poverty). Thus, concealing may feel like a protective strategy to shield the self from workplace discrimination, but it can also lead to overall more negative views towards the workplace. Cook, Salter, and Stadler (2017) go in a different direction by examining the effects of concealment of a chronic and progressive disease: multiple sclerosis (MS). Their sample was composed of participants who were at the early stages of MS where the disease could be concealed from others. For participants with very little disability, concealing was unrelated to well-being. For participants with more disability (the initial stages of gait impairment), concealment was related to lowered well-being. Thus, similar to other studies on concealment, the effects of keeping an identity concealed seem to be mostly negative and particularly harmful for psychological well-being (e.g., Beals et al., 2009; Quinn et al., 2014). However, when the authors examined the extent of disease progression at 1 year, initial concealment was related to less disease progression (controlling for initial levels of disease progression). Thus, concealment had both negative and positive ramifications that changed over time and with disease progression. Again, this highlights the complexity of consequences to concealment. In the final article of the section, Lattanner and Richman (2017) present a theoretical model to explain how concealing one's mental illness can impact important relationship processes, such as gaining social support. In preliminary support of their model, they find that people who internalize negative stereotypes about their mental illness are more likely to have avoidant social goals and these goals in turn lead to self-silencing, which predicts lowered social support. This pathway from internalized stigma to social support was moderated by concealment: it only occurred for those high in concealment. For people who were more open about their mental illness, the process did not occur. Linking back to studies by Ryan et al. (2017) and by Overstreet et al. (2017) in the first section of this issue, the role of internalized stigma and its interaction with concealment again emerges. People with internalized stigma may be particularly worried about rejection and negative treatment and thus concealment is a protective strategy. However, as shown here and in the Newheiser et al. (2017) work, it can backfire if concealing cuts a person off from social support and relationships. Supporting the relationship between concealment and rejection, the authors ran a second study in which participants with a mental illness history were asked to recall a time they felt social rejection due to their mental illness (or recall a control, nonrejection situation). They found that level of concealment interacted with the stigma recall such that those who were high in concealment and recalled social rejection had the highest levels of avoidant social goals. Thus, people may conceal their stigma to protect themselves from social rejection, but doing so may also attenuate helpful socially supportive relationships. The current issue seeks to move the field forward on the causes and consequences of concealing a socially stigmatized identity. We believe this issue makes two major contributions to the field. First, the issue takes a multilevel approach to understanding the causes of concealment, including work at the structural, relational, and individual level, addressing a criticism of stigma work that too much focus is given to individual factors (Link & Phelan, 2001). Second, the issue endeavors to understand more about the complexity and process of concealment consequences. Previous work, primarily with cross-sectional, correlational designs has found a consistent association between concealing and lowered psychological well-being measures (e.g., Park, Bharadwaj, & Blank, 2011; Quinn et al., 2014; Zea, Reisen, Poppen, Bianchi, & Echeverry, 2005). However, the relationship between concealment and health outcomes may be more complex with some studies showing relationship between concealment and worse health outcomes (e.g., Cole et al., 1996) whereas others show either a small positive relationship (e.g., Frost, Parsons, & Nanin, 2007) or an interactive effect (Weisz, Quinn, & Williams, 2015; see Quinn, in press for review). The relationship between concealment and work related outcomes also appear to be negative, yet the research and theory presented in this issue make a point that people concealing in a particular work place may be concealing for either internal reasons, such as internalized or anticipated stigma, or because the norms and institutional guidelines steer people towards concealment, or, more likely, an interaction of the two (Lyons et al., 2017; Wessel, 2017). Thus, in examining the effects of concealment in the workplace, it will be important to not only look at those who conceal versus reveal, but to examine differences within similar work contexts and to look at both psychological outcomes (satisfaction, well-being) and work outcomes (promotion, turnover). In short, there is still much work to be done. The current issue presents the state-of-the-science work in concealment of stigmatized identities, presenting both new findings and new questions. In each article in the issue, authors reflect on the policy implications of their work. In addition, the final concluding article of the issue takes a broader multilevel view of the association between concealment and social change. Indeed, what is clear throughout many of the articles is that at the personal level, there is a tension between concealing and revealing. Concealing is self-protective and works to shield the self from potential serious outcomes including losing a job or promotion, experiencing direct discrimination and physical harassment, derision, and social rejection. On the other hand, revealing can bring both personal rewards—higher well-being, more social support, more work satisfaction—and has the potential to create new, more egalitarian social norms by reducing stigma and normalizing differences. Moreover, disclosure by large numbers of people can ultimately lead to social change. However, given the potential costs to those who disclose, researchers and policy makers should be cautious in adopting a blanket recommendation for disclosure over concealment. We conclude the issue with a hard look at the costs and consequences of concealment for social policy and social change while maintaining a focus on the needs of individuals (Pasek, Filip-Crawford, & Cook, 2017).",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Internalized stigma,24
10.1177/0264619620911424,A closer look at opportunities for blind adults: Impacts of stigmatization and ocularcentrism,,"Blind Canadians experience higher rates of unemployment, social isolation, and poverty than sighted Canadians. Examining what influences opportunities can help to identify the factors that disable blind people. During initial analysis, stigma and ocularcentrism emerged as important factors. Thus, this article examines how stigma operates culturally, socially, politically, and economically to shape opportunities among blind adults. Data were collected through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with six legally blind participants (visual acuity of 20/200 or below), aged 19–65 years. Thematic analysis was employed to understand the common and diverging narratives of participants. Within participant narratives, ocularcentrism is found to contribute to stigmatization at societal, interpersonal, and internalized levels. Opportunities are experienced within this context, and the stigmatization experienced both shaped and was shaped by participation in activities. It is imperative that a closer look is given to how stigma shapes the opportunities for blind people, so that individuals, teachers, practitioners, and policy makers can develop relevant and effective interventions and can challenge stigmatization.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Internalized stigma,17
10.3389/fpubh.2017.00100,It’s a Process: Reactions to HIV Diagnosis and Engagement in HIV Care among High-Risk Heterosexuals,,"After HIV diagnosis, heterosexuals in high-poverty urban areas evidence delays in linkage to care and antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation compared to other groups. Yet barriers to/facilitators of HIV care among these high-risk heterosexuals are under-studied. Under the theory of triadic influence, putative barriers to HIV care engagement include individual/attitudinal-level (e.g., fear, medical distrust), social-level (e.g., stigma), and structural-level influences (e.g. poor access). Participants were African American/Black and Hispanic adults found newly diagnosed with HIV (N=25) as part of a community-based HIV testing study with heterosexuals in a high-poverty, high-HIV-incidence urban area. A sequential explanatory mixed-methods design was used. We described linkage to HIV care and clinical outcomes (CD4 counts, viral load levels) over one year, and then addressed qualitative research questions about the experience of receiving a new HIV diagnosis, its effects on timely engagement in HIV care, and other barriers and facilitators. Participants were assessed five times, receiving a structured interview battery, laboratory tests, data extraction from the medical record, a post-test counseling session, and in-person/phone contacts to foster linkage to care. Participants were randomly selected for qualitative interviews (N=15/25) that were recorded and transcribed, then analyzed using systematic content analysis. Participants were 50 years old, on average (SD=7.2 years), mostly male (80%), primarily African American/Black (88%), and low socioeconomic status. At the first follow-up, rates of engagement in care were high (78%), but viral suppression was modest (39%). Rates improved by the final follow-up (96% engaged, 62% virally suppressed). Two-thirds (69%) were adequately retained in care over one year. Qualitative results revealed multi-faceted responses to receiving an HIV diagnosis. Problems accepting and internalizing one's HIV status were common. Reaching acceptance of one's HIV-infected status was frequently a protracted and circuitous process, but acceptance is vital for engagement in HIV care. Fear of stigma and loss of important relationships were potent barriers to acceptance. Thus, partially as a result of difficulties accepting HIV status, delays in achieving an undetectable viral load are common in this population, with serious potential negative consequences for individual and public health. Interventions to foster acceptance of HIV status are needed.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Internalized stigma,33

The cis (n = 33) and trans people (n = 5) who participated in our project about health, violence, and social services acknowledged the stigma associated with sex work but were not governed by the dominant discourse about its moral stain. They shared nuanced insights about the relationship between sex work and self-respect as people who use their earnings to mitigate the struggles of poverty and ongoing drug use, and care for themselves more broadly.

The focus of the article is on the review of empirical research that suggests that racism adversely affects the health of nondominant racial populations in multiple ways. First, institutional racism developed policies and procedures that have reduced access to housing, neighborhood and educational quality, employment opportunities, and other desirable resources in society. Second, cultural racism, at the societal and individual level, negatively affects economic status and health by creating a policy environment hostile to egalitarian policies, triggering negative stereotypes and discrimination that are pathogenic and fostering health-damaging psychological responses, such as stereotype threat and internalized racism. Finally, a large and growing body of evidence indicates that experiences of racial discrimination are an important type of psychosocial stressor that can lead to adverse changes in health status and altered behavioral patterns that increase health risks.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Internalized stigma,1053

The theory contends that social constructions influence the policy agenda and the selection of policy tools, as well as the rationales that legitimate policy choices. Constructions become embedded in policy as messages that are absorbed by citizens and affect their orientations and participation. The theory is important because it helps explain why some groups are advantaged more than others independently of traditional notions of political power and how policy designs reinforce or alter such advantages. An understanding of social constructions of target populations augments conventional hypotheses about the dynamics of policy change, the determination of beneficiaries and losers, the reasons for differing levels and types of participation among target groups, and the role of policy in democracy.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Internalized stigma,2333

Few studies have examined mental illnesses in the Roma, and none have examined the Roma children. The present study estimates mental health and behavioral disorders among Roma children in comparison to non-Roma children in educational institutions.Data were drawn from the School Children Mental Health Study in Europe (SCHME) study in Romania (Roma children identified by parent report, N = 70; non-Roma, N = 925) and Bulgaria (Roma children identified by exclusively-Roma schools, N = 65; non-Roma, N = 1312). The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was given to the parents and teachers to measure child mental health; children reported on their mental health through the Dominique Interactive. Control covariates included child sex and age, and parental characteristics when parent reports were available.Based on the child's own report, Roma children had a higher odds of any internalizing disorder (OR = 2.99, 95% C.I. 2.07-4.30), phobias (OR = 4.84, 95% C.I. 3.19-7.35), separation anxiety disorder (OR = 2.54, 95% C.I. 1.72-3.76), generalized anxiety disorder (OR = 2.95, 95% C.I. 1.75-4.96), and major depressive disorder (OR = 3.86, 95% C.I. 2.31-6.37).

10.1002/jia2.26042,"What can we learn from HIV, COVID‐19 and mpox stigma to guide stigma‐informed pandemic preparedness?",,"The widespread emergence of stigma in the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in comparisons with the devaluing, mistreatment and blame that people living with HIV have experienced for over four decades [1]. More recently, there were calls to learn from these epidemics to inform mpox responses [2]. Each of these epidemics reveals social processes of ""othering,"" whereby a person or group is labelled as ""abnormal,"" and of lower value than, one's ""normal"" self [3]. This othering fosters stigma that involves sequelae of social distancing and mistreatment, and ultimately reduces access to resources, power and opportunities. Stigma conceptual frameworks can inform pandemic preparedness to mitigate stigma in future pandemic responses. A framework relevant to understanding similar processes of stigma targeting HIV, COVID-19 and mpox includes three stigma archetypes: the ""foreign"" other, the ""immoral"" other and the ""visibly"" unwell. The first such archetype involves blaming a ""foreign"" other for epidemics, which is a historically recurring narrative [4]. In the case of the Bubonic plague, Jewish people were blamed in medieval Europe, and Chinese communities were blamed in 1900 in San Franciso [4]. Another illustrative example is syphilis, whereby countries blamed their neighbour: Russia referred to syphilis as a Polish disease, Poland referred to it as a German disease and France called it the ""Neopolitan"" disease [5]. With regard to HIV, Haitians were blamed for the emergence of HIV in the United States in the early 1980s, comprising one of the four ""H"" groups considered at elevated risk for HIV transmission and acquisition (the other ""H""s' included homosexuals, heroin users and haemophiliacs) [6]. Persons of Asian descent were blamed for the COVID-19 pandemic across global contexts resulting in anti-Asian racism. This stigma was exacerbated by the initial naming of COVID-19 as the ""Wuhan"" or ""China"" virus by the media and key opinion leaders. Mpox, most often affecting persons living in Central and West Africa, is described as spreading to Europe or North America via travel of persons or animals originating from these regions. Indeed, two strains of mpox are labelled ""West African"" and ""Congo Basin Central,"" and the World Health Organization (WHO) recently renamed the virus from monkeypox to mpox and plans to rename the clades, as it recommends that illnesses are not named after a place or animal to reduce the potential for stigma. The second stigma archetype is the ""immoral"" other. Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM) experience social, healthcare and often legal stigma across global contexts. They were blamed for the spread of both HIV [6] and recent mpox epidemics [2] through a focus on individual sexual practices; this individual focus can obscure larger social and historical mistreatment and exclusion that increase vulnerability to infectious diseases and constrain healthcare access. UNAIDS warned against public reporting on mpox that may ""reinforce homophobic and racist stereotypes and exacerbate stigma"" [7] and others have emphasized the importance of health messaging that avoids stereotyping Africans and gbMSM [2]. In the case of COVID-19, persons not following pandemic restrictions were labelled ""super spreaders"" at the beginning of the pandemic, and more recently, there have been debates over whether stigmatizing unvaccinated persons as ""immoral"" is warranted [8]. Robust evidence, however, warns against ever using stigma as a public health tool, as it can cause further harm to marginalized communities [9]. Finally, the third stigma archetype targets persons with a ""visible"" health condition [3], aligning with the importance of considering concepts of peril, visibility and controllability [10]. Peril refers to how dangerous a stigmatized illness is perceived to be [10]. Visibility also shapes stigma experiences, whereby a person with a visible stigmatized condition manages tensions regarding being discredited and persons with an invisible stigma manage disclosure decisions (to who, when and how) [3]. Controllability refers to how much an individual is viewed as responsible for the stigmatized condition [10]. These three factors converge to shape how stigma is produced and perpetuated and can be applied to better understand HIV, COVID-19 and mpox stigma. For instance, U = U messaging reduces HIV stigma by raising awareness of HIV as a treatable, non-transmissible health condition, in turn reducing the peril surrounding HIV [11]. Visible signs of HIV-associated health conditions, such as Kaposi's sarcoma, can increase HIV stigma exposure. Persons perceived as responsible for acquiring HIV through sexual practices experience greater stigma in contrast with persons constructed as ""innocent victims,"" such as haemophiliacs, as they are perceived to have been able to control their infection risk [2]. In the case of COVID-19, fear of infection and perceived severity of COVID-19—reflecting increased peril—were associated with higher stigma [12]. Visible ethno-racial minorities, specifically persons of Asian descent, continue to experience mistreatment and even violence linked with blame for COVID-19. As vaccination is linked with the controllability of COVID-19, unvaccinated persons are blamed for causing harm to themselves and their communities. Others, however, situate COVID-19 risk and vaccine hesitancy in larger social and structural contexts, including structural racism. For mpox, the existing diagnostic tools, vaccines and treatment—unlike in the early epidemics of HIV and COVID-19 [2]—and its low mortality may reduce perceived peril. Yet, persons with mpox discuss the stigma and distress that are exacerbated with visible lesions. While the WHO and others describe mpox as controllable among gbMSM through altering sexual practices, which may increase stigma exposure, there are concerns raised regarding the lack of urgency in increasing global access to mpox testing, vaccination and treatment [2]. We can apply these lessons learned on stigma processes from HIV, COVID-19 and mpox to guide stigma-informed pandemic preparedness. In addition to assessing social processes of othering, and perceptions of peril, visibility and controllability, principles from the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework [13] and intersectional stigma [14] can be applied by researchers, practitioners and policymakers to develop stigma-informed pandemic responses, as detailed in Table 1. Guiding questions informed by the Health Stigma and Discrimination Framework [13], for instance, can assess underlying contextually specific stigma drivers (e.g. racist stereotypes) and facilitators (e.g. health policies) that shape stigma experiences and healthcare access among affected communities. Intersectional stigma approaches focus not only on identifying interlocking social categories (e.g. race and gender) linked with power and opportunity [14], but also on leveraging community strengths and solidarity. Drivers: What prejudice, stereotypes and judgement do affected communities experience? Facilitators: What are current: social inequities, occupational health and safety standards, and legal contexts for affected populations? What are relevant health policies and healthcare access?

Similarly, mutual aid and community-driven care during COVID-19 drew on underlying values of shared humanity and solidarity to challenge multiple forms of oppression [15]. Enriching our understanding of stigma processes that span health issues, populations and contexts can help us to meet the immediate needs of affected communities and embark on long-term approaches to embed equity and social justice at the heart of pandemic preparedness and pandemic response.

10.2307/25149384,"""Ripped off"" by the System: Housing Policy, Poverty, and Territorial Stigmatization in Regent Park Housing Project, 1951-1991",,"Canada's oldest and largest public housing project, Regent Park in Toronto, was originally conceived as an ideal community for low-income families in housing hardship. By the 1990s, however, it had become virtually synonymous with socio-economic marginalization and behavioural depravity. Indeed, the broader social identity of Regent Park has become an accumulation and escalation of the stigma of its residents. The first section of this article charts the historical escalation of polarization between Regent Park residents and the Metropolitan Toronto population by comparing a series of broadly illustrative statistical traits over a 40-year period. This long-term historical perspective allows us to scrutinize the development of socio-economic marginalization both before and after the boom period of postwar capitalism from the 1940s to the 1970s. It confirms that Regent's resident population underwent a dramatic process of socio-economic divergence in comparison to the general Metropolitan Toronto population, which began in the mid to late 1960s before the onset of outright assaults on the welfare state. I flesh out the stark statistical portrayal by considering various qualitative sources such as oral testimony, letters to the author by former tenants, rare resident case files, and internal and public documents from the various housing authorities. In the second section, I explain the rise of socio-economic inequality. Contrary to currently popular underclass theories, I directly point the arrow of responsibility for rising poverty and inequality towards state housing policies, including wider urban renewal strategies and internal public housing practices, and neoliberal economic restructuring. Unlike most studies, I centre in a third section on the potently deleterious effects of stereotyping Regent Park as an outcast space. Stigmatizing renderings by external observers were not free-floating ideological representations but real reflections and shapers of spatial and social divisions with concrete economic and social consequences for tenants. I conclude by discussing what residents themselves thought about their homes and how they coped with stigmatization and material deprivation. Sometimes accepting and internalizing negative external representations and/or projecting these labels onto their neighbours and other times resolutely battling against these brutalizing depictions, Regent Park residents were always active players in building a meaningful living space.

			Le projet de logements le plus ancien et le plus grand du Canada, Regent Park a Toronto, a ete initialement concu comme une communaute ideale pour les familles a faible revenu ayant des difficultes a trouver un logement. Dans les annees 1990, toutefois, il a est devenu virtuellement synonyme de marginalisation socio-economique et de depravation comportementale. A vrai dire, l'identite sociale la plus large de Regent Park est devenue une accumulation et une intensification du stigma de ses residents. La premiere section de cet article trace l'intensification historique de la polarisation entre les residents de Regent Park et la population de Toronto metropolitain en comparant une serie de traits statistiques largement illustratifs sur une periode de 40 ans. Cette perspective historique a long terme nous permet de surveiller le developpement de la marginalisation socio-economique tant avant qu'apres la periode de grande prosperite du capitalisme d'apres-guerre, des annees 1940 aux annees 1970. L'article confirme que la population de Regent Park a subi un processus dramatique de divergences socio-economique en comparaison avec la population generale de Toronto metropolitain, qui a commence vers le milieu et la fin des annees 1960 avant que commence les assauts directs sur l'Etat-providence. J'enleve les statistiques pures en prenant en consideration des sources qualitatives variees telles que les temoignages oraux, les lettres envoyees a l'auteur par les anciens locataires, les rares dossiers des residents, ainsi que les documents internes et publics de differentes autorites en matiere d'habitation. Dans la deuxieme section, j'explique la venue de l'inegalite socio-economique. Contrairement aux theories populaires courantes des classes marginales, j'attribue la responsabilite de la pauvrete et de l'inegalite croissante directement aux politiques de logement de l'Etat, y comprises strategies de renouvellement urbain et les pratiques internes relatives au logement public, ainsi que la restructuration economique neoliberale. A la difference de la plupart des etudes, je me concentre dans une troisieme section sur les effets potentiellement dangereux de stereotyper Regent Park comme un espace ostracise. Les conclusions stigmatisantes des observateurs externes n'etaient pas des representations ideologiques libres, mais plutot de vraies reflexions sur les divisions spatiales et sociales ayant des consequences economiques et sociales concretes pour les locataires. Pour conclure, je discute de ce que les residents eux-memes pensaient de leurs foyers et de la facon dont ils ont fait face a la stigmatisation et a la depravation materielle. Quelquefois, ils ont accepte et interiorise les representations negatives externes et/ou projete ces etiquettes a leurs voisins; en d'autre temps, ils se sont battus contre ces expressions brutales. Quoi qu'il en soit, les residents de Regent Park ont toujours ete des participants actifs dans la construction d'un espace vital significatif.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Internalized stigma,58

Research is needed that will comprehensively characterize the critical pathogenic features of social environments and identify how they combine with each other to affect health over the life course. Migration history and status are also important predictors of health and research is needed that will enhance understanding of the complex ways in which race, SES, and immigrant status combine to affect health. Fully capturing the role of race in health also requires rigorous examination of the conditions under which medical care and genetic factors can contribute to racial and SES differences in health.

10.1542/peds.106.1.52,Accuracy of Teen and Parental Reports of Obesity and Body Mass Index,,"Adolescent obesity is becoming an increasing public health problem. This study determines: 1) differences in teen and parental report of obesity, 2) amount of misclassification using body mass index (BMI) from self-reported versus measured height and weight as an indicator of obesity, and 3) whether misclassification varies by gender and socioeconomic status.Weighted data from 15 483 baseline (T1) youth and parental interviews from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were used. Seventy-four percent of teens were reinterviewed 1 year later (T2). Parents reported socioeconomic status indicators and whether their teen was obese. Teens reported height, weight, and weight perception. BMI was calculated from both self-reported height and weight at T1 and T2 and from measured height and weight at T2. Those with a BMI > or =95% corrected for age and gender were considered obese.At T1, nearly one half of teens (47%) reporting they were very overweight were not obese by BMI. For teens obese by BMI, 19.6% were reported to be obese by both parent and teen, 6.4% by teen only, 29. 9% by parent only, and 44.2% by neither teen nor parent. For those with persistent obesity, teen and/or parental report failed to identify more than one third (34%) as obese; 23.4% were identified by both teen and parent report, 5.4% by teen report only, and 37.2% by parent only. At T2, the correlation between BMI calculated from self-reported versus measured height and weight for the overall population was very strong (r = .92). Specificity of obesity status based on self-reported BMI, compared with obesity status based on measured BMI was .996; sensitivity, .722; positive predictive value, .860; and negative predictive value, .978. Overall, 3.8% of teens were misclassified using self-report measures. Girls were no more likely than boys to be misclassified as obese using BMI from self-reported height and weight.Parental report is a better indicator of obesity than teen report of weight status, but parental and teen reports are both poor predictors of adolescent obesity. Using BMI based on self-reported height and weight correctly classified 96% as to obesity status. Thus, studies can use self-reported height and weight to understand teen obesity and its correlates/sequelae.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Internalized stigma,737

Stereotype endorsement, disadvantage awareness, and social-emotional challenges in socioeconomically disadvantaged children.",,"Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with social-emotional difficulties, including internalizing and externalizing problems, as early as toddlerhood. The aim of the current study was to understand whether economically disadvantaged children's beliefs about the consequences and correlates of poverty (poverty stereotypes) and their beliefs about their personal economic disadvantage contribute to their social-emotional functioning. Interviews were conducted with 94 socioeconomically diverse 4- to 9-year-old children, whose parents reported on their social-emotional functioning and family socioeconomic disadvantage. As hypothesized, among relatively socioeconomically disadvantaged children, perceived disadvantage was associated with social-emotional functioning. The same relation was not found for relatively socioeconomically advantaged children. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children who endorsed higher levels of personal disadvantage had more attention problems and more anxious-depressive symptoms than socioeconomically disadvantaged children who endorsed lower levels of personal disadvantage. In addition, only among socioeconomically disadvantaged children (and not among relatively advantaged children) was negative stereotyping associated with attention problems. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children who endorsed more negative stereotypes had higher levels of attention problems. There was no evidence of an association between negative stereotyping and anxious-depressive symptoms and no moderation of this relation by socioeconomic status. Implications and directions for future research are discussed in light of several relevant theoretical frameworks, including stigma consciousness, status anxiety, and critical consciousness.

10.1159/000446054,Putting the Social into Personal Identity: The Master Narrative as Root Metaphor for Psychological and Developmental Science,,"""In the social jungle of human existence, there is no feeling of being alive without a sense of identity."" [Erikson, 1968, p. 130]""The 'methodology of causation' can neither capture the social and personal richness of lives in a culture nor begin to plumb their historical depth. It is only through the application of interpretation that we, as psychologists, can do justice to the world of culture."" [Bruner, 1990, p. 137]On a hot summer night in Tel Aviv in 2005, a 17-year-old Jewish Israeli named Ayelet1 shared her views on a particularly divisive issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as part of a life-story interview:As much as I want to understand them [the Palestinians], I can't give up my country. I can't give up Jerusalem. As much as I don't live there and I don't really go to the Wall and everything and don't pray and I'm not that religious. But still it's important for me, for my people.Just one year prior, during our initial life-story interview, Ayelet had passionately argued for the division of Jerusalem in the interest of peace [see Hammack, 2011a]. Now, one year later, and interestingly one year after she has engaged with Palestinians in intergroup dialogue, Ayelet presents a personal narrative subordinate to a collective, master narrative in which the discursive demands of social identity reign supreme. No longer do Ayelet's personal views on Jerusalem matter, for what matters to Ayelet is that her personal narrative aligns with a master narrative of a particular place - Jerusalem - and its significance to the collective. To make meaning of Ayelet's personal narrative, we need to recognize the salience of social identity in the course of human development. And we need to recognize the inherent limits to agency involved in the identity development process - a recognition facilitated by the internalized social speech [Vygotsky, 1978] apparent in her personal narrative.When Ayelet was interviewed in 2005, the dominant ways of thinking about narrative identity tended to emphasize narratives as long-term autobiographical projects which provide a sense of psychological unity and coherence [e.g., McAdams, 2001], or as discourses with which individuals engage in situated interactions [e.g., Bamberg, 2004; see Thorne, 2004]. Ayelet's narrative could be understood through the prism of both these general approaches. On the one hand, at age 17, she was just beginning to ""get a life"" [Habermas & Bluck, 2000] through the initial construction of a life story that could make meaning of her social and political context. Surely shifts over time in narrative content were likely to be part of this psychological project, as she engaged with the ""menu"" of themes available in her cultural setting [McAdams & Pals, 2006]. On the other hand, other portions of her interview revealed the process through which Ayelet came to reverse her position on Jerusalem and to emphasize the demands of social identity over time:[After dialogue], I told my friends what all the Palestinians had said, and they said to me there's no way it could all be true. Like what they said about the checkpoints and … the injustices, or … stuff that goes on in the West Bank with the army … it's just not true. I think they were just exaggerating it.This excerpt from Ayelet's narrative suggests that through interactions with peers after dialogue, she came to change her position on peace, justice, and the Palestinians. These situated interactions served to consolidate allegiance to her ingroup and the ""master narrative"" of a particular place and its collective significance Ayelet perceived as dominant at the time.To make meaning of these types of narratives, it seemed at the time (2005-2006) that the two perspectives on narrative identity development - one that emphasized autobiographical projects and one that emphasized narrative in discursive interaction - called for integration. Just as we needed to put ""the person into social identity"" [Thorne, 2004], we needed to put the social into personal identity. In this theoretical climate, we began to develop our framework of master narrative engagement [see Cohler & Hammack, 2007; Hammack, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011a, b; Hammack & Cohler, 2009].The qualitative, interpretive approach to narrative we applied allowed us to make meaning of these shifts in Ayelet's engagement with, and internalization of, master narratives over time, for it allowed us to not just take Ayelet's personal narrative at ""face value,"" applying a ""hermeneutics of faith"" [Josselson, 2004]. Rather, our interpretive approach allowed us to ""plumb the historical depth"" [Bruner, 1990] of Ayelet's life and to see the way in which her social location as a secular Jewish Israeli narrating a life story at a time of rising religious nationalism created particular pressures to internalize a new master narrative. Consistent with the epistemological underpinnings of narrative psychology [e.g., Bruner, 1990; Cohler, 1982; Polkinghorne, 1988], our interpretive approach allowed us to apply a ""hermeneutics of suspicion"" [Josselson, 2004] in which we could deeply interrogate Ayelet's production of a personal narrative over time. Applying narrative methods not just at the level of the person but also at the level of the culture, documenting not just the discourse of Ayelet's personal narrative but also the multiple discourses that proliferated in her social ecology of development and created multiple master narratives to which she was exposed [Hammack, 2011a], we developed a theory and an approach to the study of narrative, identity, and culture that emphasized the mutual constitution of persons and settings through a process of narrative engagement [Hammack, 2008, 2011a, b].The idea of master narrative engagement was intended to provide an integrative theory of human development, anchored in several long-established social science paradigms, grounded in the idea that persons and settings - selves and societies - are mutually constituted through a dynamic engagement with the symbolic meaning system of language in its storied form. Beyond anchoring perspectives on narrative identity development [e.g., Bruner, 1990; Cohler, 1982; McAdams, 1996, 2001], life course developmental theory [e.g., Elder, 1998], and cultural psychology [e.g., Shweder, 1990], theoretical inspirations for the framework included Eriksonian identity theory [e.g., Erikson, 1959], cultural-historical activity theory [CHAT; e.g., Vygotsky, 1978], symbolic interactionism [e.g., Mead, 1934], social identity theory [Tajfel & Turner, 1986], and Foucault's theory of discourse and subjectivity [e.g., Foucault, 1978, 1982]. This theoretical anchoring allowed us to moderate the historical emphasis on personal agency in some theories of narrative and identity [e.g., McAdams, 2001] with perspectives that emphasized the power of social structures and the social categorization process to shape individual subjectivity [e.g., Foucault, 1978; Tajfel & Turner, 1986]. Cultural psychology's thesis of mutual constitution through linguistic mediation [e.g., Bakhtin, 1981; Vygotsky, 1978], as well as symbolic interactionism's thesis of self-development through social interaction and the ""conversation of gestures"" [Mead, 1934], provided us with a dynamic way of theorizing the link among narrative, identity, and culture [see Hammack & Toolis, 2015].Over time, the framework of master narrative engagement has come to infuse all of our empirical work, guiding us toward diverse areas of inquiry, united in the fundamental premise that it is through a dynamic engagement with master narratives that both individual and societal/cultural development proceed [Hammack & Toolis, 2015]. In other words, we saw the idea of master narrative engagement as providing not just a framework for thinking about individual lives but also as a framework for thinking about social change. The reproduction or repudiation of master narratives in the course of development was conceived as the empirical window into the trajectory of an individual, a group, a society [e.g., Hammack, 2008, 2011a]. In the language of Kuhn [1962], the idea of the master narrative became the paradigm through which we viewed our own scientific enterprise, and we hoped to stimulate others to see the value in this concept. In the language of Sarbin [1986], following Pepper [1942], we saw the master narrative as a root metaphor for not just psychological and developmental science, but for social science more broadly [Hammack & Pilecki, 2012].Thus it is with great enthusiasm that we comment upon the framework proposed here by McLean and Syed [this issue] - a framework that we are gratified to say has been heavily influenced by our ideas, as well as many others in the broader field of narrative psychology. In the remainder of this commentary, we highlight points of overlap and distinction between the two frameworks. First, we suggest that, although the master narrative concept and underlying theory proposed by McLean and Syed overlaps considerably with our theory of master narrative engagement, they offer a valuable elaboration and extension that we suspect will be enormously useful to the field. They imbue the master narrative concept we and others have discussed at length with more specificity and precision, and hence McLean and Syed's framework is likely to be highly generative of new empirical work that can make use of their taxonomic system. As part of our discussion of conceptual overlap and distinction, we clarify the emphasis on structural constraint over agency in our own framework. We highlight the key distinction between frameworks in a discussion of interpretive versus post-positivist epistemologies to the study of narrative identity development. We conclude by returning to the idea of the master narrative as root metaphor for psychological and developmental science.McLean and Syed suggest that the term ""master narrative"" has been used in multiple and perhaps inconsistent ways in the literature, and they seek to offer ""a clear set of principles that define what master narratives are"" and ""an articulation of the different types of master narratives."" When we began to use the term ""master narrative"" to describe stories of collective history and identity young Israelis and Palestinians seemed to be appropriating in their personal narratives [Hammack, 2006], we were inspired not only by psychological and developmental scientists [e.g., Bamberg, 2004; Thorne & McLean, 2003] but also by historians, sociologists, and other social scientists who were speaking of narrative (though not necessarily using the term ""master"") in a similar vein [e.g., Somers, 1994; Suny, 2001]. As it had been deployed at the time, master narratives were chiefly about social categories such as gender. Bamberg [2004], for example, viewed master narratives as ""preexisting normative discourses"" (p. 331). The most important feature here lay precisely in the term master: these are compulsory discourses - storied language that individuals feel compelled to internalize and reproduce to maintain a particular social order. That idea resonated very strongly with the narrative data young Israelis and Palestinians were providing, though the narratives they seemed to be appropriating were not just about a social category; they contained prescriptive elements about the form a life story should take, as well as about events and places (e.g., Jerusalem) significant to the group.As we began to use the term in our own empirical work and to think more theoretically about the relationship between personal and master narratives, we also saw the lack of a clear definition of the concept, in spite of its intuitive appeal. We first defined a master narrative as a ""cultural script or 'dominant discourse' that proliferates in a society"" [Hammack, 2009, p. 51]. Inspired by Thorne and McLean [2003] and Bamberg [2004], we thought of master narratives as not just about historical events or collective memories but also about the basic meaning of social categories: ""[Master narratives are] dominant scripts which can be identified in cultural products and discourse (e.g., media, literature, film, textbooks). These scripts contain collective storylines that range from a group's history to notions of what it means to inhabit a particular social category"" [Hammack, 2010, p. 178]. In this definition, we expressed precision in precisely where to look for master narratives in empirical work (i.e., cultural products or artifacts and discourse), and we implicitly provided our own typology: master narratives are about events (i.e., history) and groups (i.e., social identities).McLean and Syed define master narratives as ""culturally shared stories that tell us about a given culture, and provide guidance for how to be a 'good' member of a culture; they are a part of the structure of society."" Here we find overlap between our own definition of master narrative and theirs, though our definition is perhaps more limiting (even if more precise in terms of guiding empirical inquiry) in its emphasis on history and social identity. They usefully make explicit in their definition the prescriptive nature of master narratives, suggesting that internalization of the master narrative brings with it social value for the ""good"" life. On issues of basic definition, though, the idea of master narrative within McLean and Syed's framework is consistent with prior conceptions.The novelty and conceptual innovation in McLean and Syed's framework emerges in the extraordinarily useful set of principles and the taxonomy for master narratives they posit. The theoretical innovation of their framework lies here because it offers a new account of how and why individuals may internalize or reject - reproduce or resist - narratives in the course of development. They offer a useful elaboration on the compulsory nature of master narratives, as well as their utility, ubiquity, and rigidity. These are essential ""properties"" of master narratives that have gone unarticulated in the literature but that help us to develop parameters of what we might expect as we study narrative identity development.The further generativity - perhaps the most generative aspect - in McLean and Syed's framework lies in the typology or taxonomy of master narratives they propose. As we have noted, master narratives have typically been posited in the domains of history (i.e., events) and social identity (i.e., groups), but McLean and Syed rightly note that there are other domains and other ways of thinking about the classification of master narratives. The particular way of telling a life story is itself a master narrative, as they suggest in their notion of the ""biographical"" master narrative. Our analysis of the formal properties of Israeli and Palestinian life stories revealed to us not just the historical or identity-based content these young people were internalizing but also the very way a life ought to be told in these distinct societies [Hammack, 2006, 2011a]. For example, we found that Palestinians almost universally constructed contaminated or tragic life stories, whereas Jewish Israelis constructed redemptive life stories [using the taxonomic system developed by McAdams & Bowman, 2001]. These life-story forms, we argued, were directly connected to collective expectations of what constitutes a ""good"" autobiography, consistent largely with the political aims of the group [Hammack, 2011a]. McLean and Syed's framework would have been quite useful for us to consider the different elements of master narratives these young people were internalizing and reproducing. No doubt it will provide an invaluable heuristic for future research on narrative and identity.Interestingly, McLean and Syed subsume what we might call the social-categorical master narrative (i.e., the expected storyline about the meaning of a particular social category or social identity) within the biographical master narrative, suggesting that diversity in how biographical narratives are constructed depends upon various social categories, offering the examples of women, Black Americans, and sexual minorities in the United States. We prefer to think of these types of master narratives as their own distinct ""kind,"" chiefly because we place great emphasis on the process of social categorization and its implications for human development in all of our work [e.g., Pilecki & Hammack, 2014; Toolis & Hammack, 2015]. In our view, subsuming the social-categorical master narrative within the biographical privileges personal identity by suggesting that individual cognition about the life story precedes consideration of social cognition. We come from a position that, as the title of this commentary suggests, privileges the significance of social categorization and its impact on human development. Hence we prefer to think of these different ""types"" of master narratives ""on the same metric"" (to borrow a phrase from McLean and Syed). Regardless, we suspect that the basic typology for master narratives McLean and Syed propose will prove remarkably generative for the field, even as it may be adapted or elaborated by future researchers.The general concept of the master narrative thus overlaps between McLean and Syed's framework and our own, but they have offered an invaluable elaboration and expansion in their articulation of a set of principles that define master narratives and a typology for classifying different kinds of master narratives. The assumptions and basic premises between the two frameworks, we suggest, are also overlapping. In other words, the theory at the root of their framework is consistent with the premises of master narrative engagement.In another point of convergence, McLean and Syed propose a vision of identity development ""that attends to both the individual as well as the cultural structures in which the individual develops and, importantly, captures the dynamics of that relationship."" Inspired chiefly by Erikson [1959, 1968], they propose a framework of identity as the conceptual link between self and society.We propose that the concept of master narratives provides a framework for understanding the nature of this intersection between self and society … As individuals construct a personal narrative, they negotiate with and internalize these master narratives - they are the material they have to work with to understand how to live a good life.For McLean and Syed, the master narrative concept represents the ideal prism through which to interrogate the self-society link, and they emphasize the importance of thinking of narrative not as ""product"" but also as ""process.""In these core claims about their framework, we find strong echoes of our theory of master narrative engagement, the central tenet of which is that human development is characterized by a dynamic process through which individuals and societies negotiate the meaning of lives, events, and groups through an engagement with narratives [e.g., Hammack, 2008, 2010, 2011a, b]. We described identity as… ideology cognized through the individual engagement with discourse, made manifest in a personal narrative constructed and reconstructed across the life course and scripted in and through social interaction and social practice. In this way, the content of identity is inherently ideological, assuming a narrative structure and realized in and through social experience. [Hammack, 2008, p. 230]Here we were inspired by Erikson [1959, 1968] to think about master narratives as conveying an ideology - a system of beliefs about the world that says something about one's social and political location [see also McAdams, 2001]. This terminological distinction hints at an important addendum to theories of narrative and identity we made early on and have continuously made over the course of our research: narratives are not ""neutral"" but assume an ideological position with implications for the social order. Identity is both process (it is made through social practice) and product (it is codified in the personal narrative that integrates the discourse of master narratives), but identities are always constructed from social and political locations [Hammack, 2008; Hammack & Toolis, 2015]. Consistent with social identity theory, we argue that the identity development process fundamentally involves a competition of value-laden discourses with implications for power and status at both the individual and collective levels [Hammack & Toolis, 2015]. Hence whether a young Jewish Israeli appropriates the discourse of united (the dominant perspective) versus divided (the marginalized perspective) Jerusalem has significant implications for the social location of the person. (Ayelet positions herself with the far ""left"" in Israel when she argues for a divided Jerusalem and with the more dominant ""center"" or ""right"" when she argues for united, Israeli-controlled Jerusalem.) Our point here is that identity development is a deeply social and political process and product of human development, and our framework sought precisely to inject the field of narrative and identity with a perspective that highlighted the social and political.A core part of our theory of identity, and a point of divergence especially from existing perspectives in psychological and developmental science at the time, was the notion that individuals are fundamentally constrained in the course of narrative identity development. We sought to challenge dominant perspectives that either implicitly or explicitly privileged the largely agentic person, constructing a life story from available ""themes"" and ""menus,"" free to choose at will what may constitute the ""good"" life [e.g., McAdams & Pals, 2006]. That all of our empirical work occurred with groups at the margins - Palestinians living under military occupation, Israelis living in the context of historical persecution and existential insecurity, sexual and gender identity minorities living in the contexts of heterosexism and cisgenderism, unhoused individuals living in the context of stigma and economic subordination - led us to question the implicit emphasis on personal agency in most theoretical statements on narrative.The main distinction between McAdams's overall theoretical framework and the one advanced in this article is primarily connected to the emphasis on culture and the role of agency in identity development. Likely because his work is based in the American cultural context, McAdams's approach tends to ascribe significant agency to individuals as they construct their life stories. In the perspective advanced here, I want to suggest that the relationship between a master narrative and a personal narrative is highly contingent on the cultural context of development. As a consequence, the agency that individuals possess to construct life stories varies considerably [e.g., Hammack, 2006], and it is precisely the cultural conditions of this variability that require empirical and theoretical attention in social, personality, and cultural psychology. [Hammack, 2008, p. 236]Our framework, then, diverged from dominant perspectives on narrative and identity in its relative emphasis on the constraints individuals face in the identity development process, chiefly as a result of their social identities, always positioned in some relation to a power structure in society.Given the relative emphasis on constraint in our framework, we were surprised at McLean and Syed's claim that we emphasize agency, as well as their suggestion that the terminology of ""engagement"" itself evokes a greater sense of agency in the process of identity development. Our use of the term ""engagement"" was meant to evoke a more dynamic but essentially identical process of ""internalization"" of ""social speech"" [Vygotsky, 1978] in which they seem to anchor their framework. Here there is a strong balance between agency and structure. On the one hand, social speech proliferates and exists as part of a ""verbal-ideological community"" inherently political [Bakhtin, 1981; Volosinov, 1929/1973; see Hammack & Toolis, 2015]. On the other hand, inner speech becomes manifest as individuals encounter the symbolic meaning system of language and learn through social practice [Vygotsky, 1978]. The key theoretical point here is that the existence of social speech precedes the development of inner speech and hence the internalization process is always first constrained by the content and structure of master narratives. In concluding one of our first empirical papers on Israeli and Palestinian youth, the relative emphasis on structural constraint over agency is clearly articulated:Although this study reveals the possibilities of cultural transformations through the ideologies of a new generation, it also reveals the limits of agency in human development. The context of conflict creates unique challenges for adolescent identity development, and the malleability of identity polarization may indeed be limited by a social structure characterized by the perception of existential threat and the need for ingroup solidarity. [Hammack, 2006, p. 362]A claimed emphasis on agency in our empirical work on narrative identity thus represents something of a misread, since our point of departure is always the social context and its matrix of social categories [consistent with social identity theory; Tajfel & Turner, 1986]. That we note and emphasize moments of ""agency"" in which individuals defy the expectations of conformity to a master narrative should not be read as a theoretical emphasis on agency but rather as an interesting finding that emerges from our typically inductive, qualitative, and interpretive approach to the study of lives in context. Thus while we dispute McLean and Syed's claim that we (over)emphasize agency, we wholeheartedly agree with their position that agency has been historically overrepresented in research on narrative identity development and that we must do a better job of attending to the constraints individuals face as they attempt to resist master narratives, especially in situations of social injustice.Our narrative analysis of the lived experiences of homeless youth [Toolis & Hammack, 2015] highlights our approach and the way in which, in the process of master narrative engagement, individuals are forced to grapple with constraining master narratives in narrating their sense of self. Each of the participants' stories in that study voiced immense frustration with the lack of power that they held at home and in schools, programs, and shelters, where they were frequently perceived as delinquent or incompetent. McLean and Syed write that our analysis neglects to examine the lack of ""actual agency to address the societal constraints and narratives that maintain income inequality."" Yet we argue that this is precisely what our findings highlight. One participant, Alejandro, articulated a painful awareness of the inequality and structural barriers that constrained his life chances:I thought I was just gonna finish high school and go to college. I thought all these thing were gonna be open for me. What happened to this, this dream that you see on TV? … It doesn't go for the people who are at the bottom. You don't get that … You gotta dig for the things you want. You gotta scrape for the things you want.Our analysis was clear to note that the youth in the study were not free to tell just any story - they were forced to contend with not only economic hardship but also the stigmatizing master narrative of the American Dream, which attributes poverty and homelessness to individual characteristics [Bullock, 2008; Limbert & Bullock, 2009], in making meaning of their experience. Indeed, the individuals interviewed struggled with being perceived as unruly, unmotivated, criminal, and pathological. Because this master narrative is so powerful, we found it especially striking that each of these youth's stories demonstrated resistance to internalizing a sense of personal fault or failure, instead calling attention to structural disadvantage by highlighting the discrimination, violence, neglect, and alienation they faced. Agency emerged as a salient theme in these cases precisely because it had been denied so constantly throughout their lives. We did emphasize agency when it occurred in the personal narratives of these youth because it pointed us toward the process of resistance to the hegemonic character of master narrative engagement which underlies our broader theory [e.g., Hammack, 2008].These findings illustrate the value in taking an interpretive approach to the study of lived experience that considers not just personal meaning making but also the social and political location from which meaning is made. Individuals without housing are all too often treated as passive objects rather than active partners in shaping the institutions and policies that affect their lives. Thus, we feel that it is important to highlight and take seriously the oppressive constraints posed by master narratives while simultaneously considering the plural and often contested ways in which individuals make sense of those narratives in constructing their lives.We are aware that psychological research has a history of presenting marginalized individuals as passive and deficient and that the study of oppression has historically eclipsed the study of resistance [Apfelbaum, 1979; Haslam & Reicher, 2012; hooks, 1990]. The need to account for (and promote) social change, and to acknowledge participants as co-constructors of knowledge, is critical and has been noted by scholars in feminist psychology [Moane, 2003; Unger, 1998; White, 2006; White & Rastogi, 2009], liberation psychology [Freire, 1970; Martín-Baró, 1994] and community psychology [Langhout, 2005; Rappaport, 2000].

10.1146/annurev-soc-071312-145702,The Stigma Complex,,"Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, research on stigma has continued. Building on conceptual and empirical work, the recent period clarifies new types of stigmas, expansion of measures, identification of new directions, and increasingly complex levels. Standard beliefs have been challenged, the relationship between stigma research and public debates reconsidered, and new scientific foundations for policy and programs suggested. We begin with a summary of the most recent Annual Review articles on stigma, which reminded sociologists of conceptual tools, informed them of developments from academic neighbors, and claimed findings from the early period of “resurgence.” Continued (even accelerated) progress has also revealed a central problem. Terms and measures are often used interchangeably, leading to confusion and decreasing accumulated knowledge. Drawing from this work but focusing on the past 14 years of stigma research (including mental illness, sexual orientation, HIV/AIDS, and race/ethnicity), we provide a theoretical architecture of concepts (e.g., prejudice, experienced/received discrimination), drawn together through a stigma process (i.e., stigmatization), based on four theoretical premises. Many characteristics of the mark (e.g., discredited, concealable) and variants (i.e., stigma types and targets) become the focus of increasingly specific and multidimensional definitions. Drawing from complex and systems science, we propose a stigma complex, a system of interrelated, heterogeneous parts bringing together insights across disciplines to provide a more realistic and complicated sense of the challenge facing research and change efforts. The Framework Integrating Normative Influences on Stigma (FINIS) offers a multilevel approach that can be tailored to stigmatized statuses. Finally, we outline challenges for the next phase of stigma research, with the goal of continuing scientific activity that enhances our understanding of stigma and builds the scientific foundation for efforts to reduce intolerance.",Openalex,Economics-related,Poverty and Internalized stigma,639

The two studies reported here were conducted to test aspects of a three-component model of commitment which integrates these various conceptualizations. The affective component of organizational commitment, proposed by the model, refers to employees' emotional attachment to, identification with, and involvement in, the organization. The continuance component refers to commitment based on the costs that employees associate with leaving the organization. Finally, the normative component refers to employees' feelings of obligation to remain with the organization. In Study 1, scales were developed to measure these components. Relationships among the components of commitment and with variables considered their antecedents were examined in Study 2. Results of a canonical correlation analysis suggested that, as predicted by the model, the affective and continuance components of organizational commitment are empirically distinguishable constructs with different correlates.

One domain of the self (actual; ideal; ought) and one standpoint on the self (own; significant other) constitute each type of self-state representation. It is proposed that different types of self-discrepancies represent different types of negative psychological situations that are associated with different kinds of discomfort. Discrepancies between the actual/own self-state (i.e., the self-concept) and ideal self-states (i.e., representations of an individual's beliefs about his or her own or a sitmifieant other's hopes, wishes, or aspirations for the individual) signify the absence of positive outcomes, which is associated with dejection-related emotions (e.g., disappointment, dissatisfaction, sadness). In contrast, discrepancies between the actual/own self-state and ought self-states (i.e., representations of an individual's beliefs about his or her own or a significant other's beliefs about the individual's duties, responsibilities, or obligations) signify the presence of negative outcomes, which is associated with agitation-related emotions (e.g., fear, threat, restlessness). Differences in both the relative magnitude and the accessibility of individuals' available types of self-discrepancies are predicted to be related to differences in the kinds of discomfort people are likely to experience.

An integrative interpretation of the construct as Negative Affectivity (NA) is presented. Extensive data indicate that high-NA individuals are more likely to experience discomfort at all times and across situations, even in the absence of overt stress. They are relatively more introspective and tend differentially to dwell on the negative side of themselves and the world. Further research is needed to explain the origins of NA and to elucidate the characteristics of low-NA individuals. Rorer and Widiger (1983) recently bemoaned that in the field of personality literature reviews appear to be disparate conglomerations rather than cumulative or conclusive integrations (p. 432). We intend this review to be an exception to this discouraging statement. Distinct and segregated literatures have developed around a number of specific personality measures that, despite dissimilar names, nevertheless intercorrelate so highly that they must be considered measures of the same construct. Following Tellegen (1982), we call this construct Negative Affectivity (NA) and present a comprehensive view of the trait that integrates data from a wide variety of relevant research. We are not the first to note this broad and pervasive personality trait. The Eysencks, for example, (e.g. Eysenck & Eysenck, 1968) have done extensive research in the area, traditionally calling the dimension Neuroticism, although in their most recent revision (Eysenck & Eysenck, 1975) they suggest a label, emotionality, that is similar to our own.

In Parables for the Virtual Brian Massumi views the body and media such as television, film, and the Internet, as cultural formations that operate on multiple registers of sensation beyond the reach of the reading techniques founded on the standard rhetorical and semiotic models.

Renewing and assessing William James’s radical empiricism and Henri

Bergson’s philosophy of perception through the filter of the post-war French philosophy of Deleuze, Guattari, and Foucault, Massumi links a cultural logic of variation to questions of movement, affect, and sensation. If such concepts are as fundamental as signs and significations, he argues, then a new set of theoretical issues appear, and with them potential new paths for the wedding of scientific and cultural theory. Replacing the traditional opposition of literal and figural with new distinctions between stasis and motion and between actual and virtual, Parables for the Virtual tackles related theoretical issues by applying them to cultural mediums as diverse as architecture, body art, the digital art of Stelarc, and Ronald Reagan’s acting career. The result is an intriguing combination of cultural theory, science, and philosophy that asserts itself in a crystalline and multi-faceted argument.

We propose that this relationship occurs because people rely on affect when judging the risk and benefit of specific hazards. Evidence supporting this proposal is obtained in two experimental studies. Study 1 investigated the inverse relationship between risk and benefit judgments under a time-pressure condition designed to limit the use of analytic thought and enhance the reliance on affect. As expected, the inverse relationship was strengthened when time pressure was introduced. Study 2 tested and confirmed the hypothesis that providing information designed to alter the favorability of one's overall affective evaluation of an item (say nuclear power) would systematically change the risk and benefit judgments for that item. Both studies suggest that people seem prone to using an 'affect heuristic' which improves judgmental efficiency by deriving both risk and benefit evaluations from a common source—affective reactions to the stimulus item.

Time-lagged analyses identify positive affect as an antecedent of creative thought, with incubation periods of up to two days. Qualitative analyses identify positive affect as a consequence of creative thought events, as well as a concomitant of the creative process.

Much of this reluctance stems from the very notion of culture: it is so broad and the channels through which it can enter the economic discourse so ubiquitous (and vague) that it is difficult to design testable, refutable hypotheses. In recent years, however, better techniques and more data have made it possible to identify systematic differences in people's preferences and beliefs and to relate them to various measures of cultural legacy. These developments suggest an approach to introducing culturally-based explanations into economics that can be tested and may substantially enrich our understanding of economic phenomena.

In Studies 3 and 5, subjects completed daily mood reports for 70 and 30 days, respectively. In Study 4, subjects completed three-week, daily, and moment mood reports and also filled out reports when they experienced strong emotions. The principal finding was that the relation between positive and negative affect differed greatly depending on the time frame. The strongest negative correlation between the two affects occurred during emotional times. The correlation decreased in a linear fashion as the time span covered increased logarithmically.

However, although NA is correlated with health compliant scales, it is not strongly or consistently related to actual, long-term health status, and thus will act as a general nuisance factor in health research.

Using data from the 1986 Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) data set, we explored the relationships among current poverty, length of time spent in poverty, maternal parenting behaviors, and children's mental health. Persistent poverty significantly predicts children's internalizing symptoms above and beyond the effect of current poverty, whereas only current poverty predicts externalizing symptoms. Mother's weak emotional responsiveness and frequent use of physical punishment explain the effect of current poverty on mental health, but not the effect of persistent poverty. The relationships among poverty, parenting behaviors, and children's mental health do not vary by race/ethnicity.

Furthermore, subsequent poverty histories were also related to children's mental health trajectories. The number of years that children were poor between 1986 and 1990 correlates significantly with changes in children's antisocial behavior during those years.

Methods An online survey was conducted with a nationally-drawn sample (N = 471) of college-attending women to assess the association between period poverty and depression. Period poverty was measured via two questions designed for this study; depression was measured with the standard PHQ-9. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized for analysis. Results Among our sample, 14.2% of women had experienced period poverty ever in the past-year; an additional 10% experienced it every month. Compared to those who had never experienced period poverty, adjusted analysis revealed that women with monthly past-year period poverty were the most likely to report moderate/severe depression (AOR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.09–4.99), followed by those who had experienced it ever in the past year (AOR = 1.83, 95% CI, 0.99–3.38).

In population-based data, this is partially explained by income differences between bisexual people and lesbian, gay, and/or heterosexual individuals. However, the interrelationships between bisexuality, poverty, and mental health are poorly understood. In this paper, we examine the relationships between these variables using a mixed methods study of 302 adult bisexuals from Ontario, Canada. Participants were recruited using respondent-driven sampling to complete an internet-based survey including measures of psychological distress and minority stress. A subset of participants completed a semi-structured qualitative interview to contextualize their mental health experiences. Using information regarding household income, number of individuals supported by the income and geographic location, participants were categorized as living below or above the Canadian Low Income Cut Off (LICO). Accounting for the networked nature of the sample, participants living below the LICO had significantly higher mean scores for depression and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and reported significantly more perceived discrimination compared to individuals living above the LICO. Grounded theory analysis of the qualitative interviews suggested four pathways through which bisexuality and poverty may intersect to impact mental health: through early life experiences linked to bisexuality or poverty that impacted future financial stability; through effects of bisexual identity on employment and earning potential; through the impact of class and sexual orientation discrimination on access to communities of support; and through lack of access to mental health services that could provide culturally competent care. These mixed methods data help us understand the income disparities associated with bisexual identity in population-based data, and suggest points of intervention to address their impact on bisexual mental health.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and mental health,63

This study examined the differential effects of poverty on the mental health of foreign-born children, Canadian-born children of immigrant parents, and children of nonimmigrant parents. Methods. Secondary analysis of data from a national Canadian study of children between 4 and 11 years of age was conducted. Results. Compared with their receiving-society counterparts, foreign-born children were more than twice as likely to live in poor families, but they had lower levels of emotional and behavioral problems. The effect of poverty on children's mental health among long-term immigrant and receiving-society families was indirect and primarily mediated by single-parent status, ineffective parenting, parental depression, and family dysfunction. In comparison, the mental health effect of poverty among foreign-born children could not be explained by the disadvantages that poor families often suffer. Conclusions. Poverty may represent a transient and inevitable part of the resettlement process for new immigrant families.

This prospective, longitudinal study included 185 low- and middle-income adolescents at age 17. Chronic exposure to poverty from birth to early adolescence (age 13) was prospectively associated with increases in the use of disengagement versus engagement coping four years later. Increased use of disengagement coping between the ages of 13 and 17 explained the indirect link between poverty exposure since birth and both externalizing and internalizing symptoms at age 17.

Based on its distribution pattern and functional similarity to OATP1B-type transporters, OATP2B1 might have a role in the absorption and disposition of a range of xenobiotics. Although several prescription drugs, including HMG-CoA inhibitors (statins) such as fluvastatin, are OATP2B1 substrates in vitro, evidence supporting the in vivo relevance of this transporter remains limited, and most has relied on substrate-inhibitor interactions resulting in altered pharmacokinetic properties of the victim drugs. In order to address this knowledge deficit, we developed and characterized an OATP2B1-deficient mouse model and evaluated the impact of this transporter on the absorption and disposition of fluvastatin. Consistent with the intestinal localization of OATP2B1, we found that the genetic or pharmacological inhibition of OATP2B1 was associated with decreased absorption of fluvastatin by 2- to 3-fold. The availability of a viable OATP2B1-deficient mouse model provides an opportunity to unequivocally determine the contribution of this transporter to the absorption and drug-drug interaction potential of drugs. <h3>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</h3> The current investigation suggests that OATP2B1-deficient mice provide a valuable tool to study the in vivo importance of this transporter. In addition, our studies have identified novel potent inhibitors of OATP2B1 among the class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, a rapidly expanding class of drugs used in various therapeutic areas that may cause drug-drug interactions with OATP2B1 substrates.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and mental health,18

These results maintained independently of concurrent, adult income levels for self-reported externalizing symptoms and a standard learned helplessness behavioral protocol, but internalizing symptoms were unaffected by childhood poverty. We then demonstrate that part of the reason why early poverty exposure is harmful to mental health among emerging adults is because of elevated cumulative risk exposure assessed at age 13.

10.1017/s2045796015000086,"Poverty, inequality and a political economy of mental health",,"The relationship between poverty and mental health is indisputable. However, to have an influence on the next set of sustainable global development goals, we need to understand the causal relationships between social determinants such as poverty, inequality, lack of education and unemployment; thereby clarifying which aspects of poverty are the key drivers of mental illness. Some of the major challenges identified by Lund (2014) in understanding the poverty-mental health relationship are discussed including: the need for appropriate poverty indicators; extending this research agenda to a broader range of mental health outcomes; the need to engage with theoretical concepts such as Amartya Sen's capability framework; and the need to integrate the concept of income/economic inequality into studies of poverty and mental health. Although income inequality is a powerful driver of poor physical and mental health outcomes, it features rarely in research and discourse on social determinants of mental health. This paper interrogates in detail the relationships between poverty, income inequality and mental health, specifically: the role of income inequality as a mediator of the poverty-mental health relationship; the relative utility of commonly used income inequality metrics; and the likely mechanisms underlying the impact of inequality on mental health, including direct stress due to the setting up of social comparisons as well as the erosion of social capital leading to social fragmentation. Finally, we need to interrogate the upstream political, social and economic causes of inequality itself, since these should also become potential targets in efforts to promote sustainable development goals and improve population (mental) health. In particular, neoliberal (market-oriented) political doctrines lead to both increased income inequality and reduced social cohesion. In conclusion, understanding the relationships between politics, poverty, inequality and mental health outcomes requires us to develop a robust, evidence-based 'political economy of mental health.'",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and mental health,107
10.1111/spc3.12168,The Psychiatrization of Poverty: Rethinking the Mental Health–Poverty Nexus,,"Abstract The positive association between ‘mental illness’ and poverty is one of the most well established in psychiatric epidemiology. Yet, there is little conclusive evidence about the nature of this relationship. Generally, explanations revolve around the idea of a vicious cycle, where poverty may cause mental ill health, and mental ill health may lead to poverty. Problematically, much of the literature overlooks the historical, social, political, and cultural trajectories of constructions of both poverty and ‘mental illness’. Laudable attempts to explore the social determinants of mental health sometimes take recourse to using and reifying psychiatric diagnostic categories that individualize distress and work to psychiatrically reconfigure ‘symptoms’ of oppression, poverty, and inequality as ‘symptoms’ of ‘mental illness’. This raises the paradoxical issue that the very tools that are used to research the relationship between poverty and mental health may prevent recognition of the complexity of that relationship. Looking at the mental health–poverty nexus through a lens of psychiatrization (intersecting with medicalization, pathologization, and psychologization), this paper recognizes the need for radically different tools to trace the messiness of the multiple relationships between poverty and distress. It also implies radically different interventions into mental health and poverty that recognize the landscapes in which lived realities of poverty are embedded, the political economy of psychiatric diagnostic and prescribing practices, and ultimately to address the systemic causes of poverty and inequality.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and mental health,97

Design/methodology/approach The paper first reviews the findings of relevant research on mental disorders and poverty and then proposes solutions that can be adopted by countries to promote development. Findings This evidence of strong links between poverty and mental disorder supports the argument that mental disorders should be an important concern for development strategies. Mental disorders have diverse and far‐reaching social impacts, including homelessness, higher rates of imprisonment, poor educational opportunities and outcomes, lack of employment and reduced income. Targeted poverty alleviation programmes are needed to break the cycle between mental illness and poverty. These must include measures specifically addressing the needs of people with mental health conditions, such as the provision of accessible and effective services and support, facilitation of education, employment opportunities and housing, and enforcement of human rights protection. Originality/value The paper highlights that four out of every five people suffering from mental disorders are living in LMICs. Many LMICs have identified mental health as an important issue, yet lack the finances and technical expertise to address the problem. Having mental health on the agenda of development organizations will be a critical step for overcoming the negative development consequences of mental disorders.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and mental health,115

Those belonging to marginalized sections face the brunt of lack of access to water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities; affordable menstrual supplies; and inequitable distribution of menstrual health education and are victims of period poverty. Their preexisting suffering was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which negatively affected the mental health of those menstruating. Adolescent girls and women in communities found it persistently challenging to access and afford menstrual products while deprived of menstrual hygiene education. These put them under immense stress and elevated financial liability, predisposing them to period poverty. Interventions addressing period poverty rely on mustering collective community voices and deploying adequate policy tools. All the efforts and solutions must provide social and financial protection nets and psychological aid through mental health support groups. It is core to drive menstrual health equity for all menstruators, irrespective of who they are, what they do, and where they live.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and mental health,25

Period poverty, understood as the lack of access to menstrual products, has been gaining attention especially among low and middle-income countries as an overlooked aspect of gendered poverty. Less is known about the incidence of period poverty in high-income countries and its association with mental health. The purpose of this study is to examine this association in a representative sample of young women living in an urban setting in southern Europe. Methods This is a cross-sectional study. Data were obtained from a representative survey of individuals aged 15 to 34 in the city of Barcelona (Spain), with a sample group of 647 young women. Subjects were selected through a systematic stratified random sampling method. A proportional quota sampling was used. The information was registered using CAPI data collection method. Period poverty was measured by a combination of three questions about the lack of access or misuse of menstrual products for economic reasons. The GHQ-12 was used to measure the risk of poor mental health. The analysis was carried out using multivariable logistic regression. Results From our sample, 15.3% of young women reported having experienced period poverty. Higher odds of poor mental health were estimated for women facing period poverty (AOR = 1.85 p &lt; 0.05). This effect is statistically significant after controlling by their income status and level of deprivation. Young women living in poorer households have a higher probability of poor mental health than those living in high-income households (AOR = 0.47 p &lt; 0.05). Finally, material deprivation was associated to an increased risk of poor mental health among young women reporting period poverty (AOR = 2.59 p &lt; 0.01). Conclusion We found that a considerable number of young women living in an urban setting in a high-income country cannot afford menstrual products, and this may have an impact on their mental wellbeing. The relationship between period poverty and respondents’ mental health is significant when controlling for factors known to confer an increased risk of poor mental health. If confirmed by further research, the public health burden of poor mental health in young women could be reduced by policy-level interventions to improve access to menstrual products.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and mental health,16

Single and married mothers were followed up over a 2-year period during which time rates of psychosocial risk factors, onset of depression and experience of chronic episodes were measured. Risk of onset was double among single mothers. Single mothers were twice as likely as their married counterparts to be in financial hardship, despite being twice as likely to be in full-time employment. Both of these factors were independently associated with onset in single mothers. The link between them and onset was via their association with humiliating or entrapping severe life events. Single parents were at a much raised risk of experiencing these events. Onset was also more likely to follow such an event when women had poor self-esteem and lack of support, both of which were more common among single mothers. These risk factors were more frequently found among those in financial hardship. Financial hardship was also related to risk of having a chronic episode (lasting at least a year), of which single parents were also at greater risk. The majority of chronic episodes among single mothers had their origins in prior marital difficulties or widowhood and rates of chronicity reduced with length of time spent in single parenthood. Results are discussed in terms of an aetiological model of onset in which financial hardship probably influences outcome at a wide variety of points.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Depression,449

In this study for a recent birth cohort of UK children we examine how three aspects of parental resources – income, mother's mental well-being and family status – in early childhood enhance or compromise their children's cognitive and behavioural development. As well as examining how these three aspects of parental resources separately and jointly affect children's well-being, we also enquire whether persistent poverty or persistent maternal depression are more deleterious for children's current well-being than periodic episodes of poverty and depression. We find strong associations between poverty and young children's intellectual and behavioural development, and persistent poverty was found to be particularly important in relation to children's cognitive development. Maternal depression (net of other factors) was more weakly related to cognitive development but strongly related to whether children were exhibiting behaviour problems, and persistent depression amplified the situation. Family status, net of other factors (most noticeably poverty), was only weakly associated with children's development.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Depression,181

Positive parenting behavior may buffer against the negative impact of child AIDS-orphanhood and caregiver AIDS-sickness on child well-being. Although there is substantial literature regarding the predictors of parenting behavior in Western populations, there is insufficient evidence on HIV/AIDS as a risk factor for poor parenting in low- and middle-income countries. This paper examines the relationship between HIV/AIDS and positive parenting by comparing HIV/AIDS-affected and nonaffected caregiver-child dyads (n=2477) from a cross-sectional survey in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (27.7% AIDS-ill caregivers; 7.4% child AIDS-orphanhood). Multiple mediation analyses tested an ecological model with poverty, caregiver depression, perceived social support, and child behavior problems as potential mediators of the association of HIV/AIDS with positive parenting. Results indicate that familial HIV/AIDS's association to reduced positive parenting was consistent with mediation by poverty, caregiver depression, and child behavior problems. Parenting interventions that situate positive parenting within a wider ecological framework by improving child behavior problems and caregiver depression may buffer against risks for poor child mental and physical health outcomes in families affected by HIV/AIDS and poverty.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Depression,97

METHOD: The authors studied a group of pregnant mothers recruited during their third trimester of pregnancy from a district hospital in Goa, India. The mothers were interviewed at recruitment, 6–8 weeks, and 6 months after childbirth. Interview data included presence of antenatal and postnatal depression, obstetric history, economic and demographic characteristics, and gender-based variables (preference for male infant, presence of marital violence). RESULTS: Depressive disorder was detected in 59 (23%) of the mothers at 6–8 weeks after childbirth; 78% of these patients had had clinically substantial psychological morbidity during the antenatal period. More than one-half of the patients remained ill at 6 months after delivery. Economic deprivation and poor marital relationships were important risk factors for the occurrence and chronicity of depression. The gender of the infant was a determinant of postnatal depression; it modified the effect of other risk factors, such as marital violence and hunger. Depressed mothers were more disabled and were more likely to use health services than nondepressed mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal and infant health policies, a priority in low-income countries, must integrate maternal depression as a disorder of public health significance. Interventions should target mothers in the antenatal period and incorporate a strong gender-based component.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Depression,770

More specifically, we use conditional logistic fixed‐effect models that control for time‐invariant unmeasured heterogeneity in the sample. Results. We found a strong relationship between hardships and depression. The most prominent hardships were problems paying bills and phone turned off.

Analyzing the relationship between energy poverty and the depression level of China's older adults will provide policy enlightenment for solving the problems of older adults' relative poverty, energy poverty, and mental poverty and thus promote happy and healthy aging. In this paper, using the data of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study in 2018, we used the entropy weighting method to objectively assign weights to 10 indicators reflecting the status of energy poverty and construct a multidimensional energy poverty index for older adults. First, we analyzed the relationship between multidimensional energy poverty and the depression levels of older adults using multiple linear regression model and quantile regression models. Next, we used instrumental variable linear regression model and instrumental variable quantile regression models for endogeneity tests. Then, we performed a robustness check by replacing the core explanatory variable. After that, we conducted heterogeneity analyses by residential area, type of residence, and solitary status. Finally, we analyzed the mediating role of life satisfaction using structural equation modeling. Multidimensional energy poverty has aggravated depression among older adults, and the effect is greater for older adults with higher depression levels. The effect of multidimensional energy poverty on depression is greater for older adults in western China, urban areas, and those who live alone.

Some 2609 mothers and adolescents provided usable data at the 14- and 21-year follow-ups. Results. After adjustment for poverty at other phases, poverty at the 14-year follow-up was the strongest predictor of adolescent and young adult anxiety and depression. The more frequently the child was exposed to poverty, the greater was the risk of that individual being anxious and depressed at both the 14- and 21-year follow-ups. Conclusions.

To determine whether the processes through which parenting practices, maternal depression, neighborhood, and chronic poverty affect child behavioral problems are similar or different in minority and nonminority children in the United States. METHODS. Data from 884 white, 538 black, and 404 Latino families with children who were 6 to 9 years of age in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth were analyzed. The outcome, child behavioral problems, was measured using the Behavior Problems Index externalizing and internalizing subscales. The effects of chronic poverty, neighborhood, maternal depression, and parenting on the outcome were analyzed using multigroup structural equation modeling. RESULTS. Chronic poverty affected child behavioral problems indirectly through the other variables, and parenting practices had direct effects in each racial/ethnic group. The effects of maternal depression were partially mediated through parenting in the white and Latino samples but were direct and unmediated through parenting practices in the black sample. Neighborhood effects were present in the white and black samples but were not significant for the Latino sample. CONCLUSIONS. Chronic poverty, neighborhood, maternal depression, and parenting practices have effects on child behavioral problems in white, black, and Latino children, but the processes and mechanisms through which they exert their effects differ among the groups.

Preschoolers 3-5 years of age were originally ascertained from primary care and day care sites in the St. Louis area and then underwent annual behavioral assessments for up to 12 years. Healthy preschoolers and those with a history of depression symptoms underwent neuroimaging at school age. Using functional MRI, the authors examined whole brain resting-state functional connectivity with the left and right hippocampus and amygdala.Lower income-to-needs ratio at preschool age was associated with reduced connectivity between hippocampus and amygdala and a number of regions at school age, including the superior frontal cortex, lingual gyrus, posterior cingulate, and putamen. Lower income-to-needs ratio predicted greater negative mood/depression severity at school age, as did connectivity between the left hippocampus and the right superior frontal cortex and between the right amygdala and the right lingual gyrus. Connectivity mediated the relationship between income-to-needs ratio and negative mood/depression at the time of scanning.These findings suggest that poverty in early childhood, as assessed by at least one measure, may influence the development of hippocampal and amygdala connectivity in a manner leading to negative mood symptoms during later childhood.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Depression,125

Our estimates from the IV quantile regression suggest a strong positive impact of energy poverty on depression at the upper quantile of depression scores, but no impact at the middle and lower quantiles. The primary results are robust and consistent with alternative energy poverty measures, and we find that energy poverty does not affect depression of low-risk individuals (with low depression scores), but it does affect that of high-risk individuals. We also find individual socio-demographic factors of age, gender, household size, religious belief, education, marriage and employment status play roles in affecting depression.

Depression in women is associated with social deprivation and violence. We describe the prevalence and risk factors for depression during pregnancy, in particular the association with poverty and violence, in a Brazilian setting. Method. A cross-sectional survey of women in the third trimester of pregnancy attending a public hospital maternity clinic from August 2003 to July 2004 in Rio de Janeiro. Participants were interviewed about their sociodemographic status, obstetric and medical conditions, substance use, stressful life events, and social support. Depression was diagnosed through the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Results. A total of 230 of 240 eligible women consented to participate. The 12-month prevalence of depression was 19·1% (95% CI 14·4–24·9). On multivariate analyses, having been educated beyond primary school was protective (OR 0·5, 95% CI 0·2–0·9).

Conversely worse depression at time 1 and time 2 was independently associated with worse economic status at time 2 (β = -0.037, SE: 0.016) and time 3 (β = -0.028, SE: 0.012) respectively. In addition, the ""effect"" of depression on future assets was stronger among people with less baseline assets.The time span between data rounds is relatively short (four years); response rates are unequal across ethnic, age and sex groups; and the measure of depression is based on self-report.Social causation and social drift act simultaneously in this population, reinforcing poverty/depression cycles. Multi-sectoral policies are required that both prevent depression by addressing its economic determinants, and provide evidence-based treatment to mitigate the economic impact of depression.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Depression,106

The purpose of this study was to test the competing theories of social causation and social selection to assess the relationship between depression and economic status for a sample of rural, low‐income women in the United States. Methods: Structural equation modeling was used to analyze data from Rural Families Speak, a US Department of Agriculture‐funded multi‐state, longitudinal study of rural low‐income families (N = 413). Findings: Results indicated that the social causation theory yielded a better approximation of the relationship between economic status and depression (RMSEA = 0.50 for a model based on this theory) than the social selection theory (RMSEA = 0.067). Conclusions: The association between lesser economic status and depressive symptoms is pressing in rural areas, given the high prevalence of both depression and poverty. These findings further emphasize the need for improved mental health services in this vulnerable population .",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Depression,75

Our review identified over 40 relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals from the mid-1990s to 2001, the take-off point for an increasing level of interest in neighborhood effects. Moving beyond traditional characteristics such as concentrated poverty, we evaluate the salience of social-interactional and institutional mechanisms hypothesized to account for neighborhood-level variations in a variety of phenomena (e.g., delinquency, violence, depression, high-risk behavior), especially among adolescents. We highlight neighborhood ties, social control, mutual trust, institutional resources, disorder, and routine activity patterns. We also discuss a set of thorny methodological problems that plague the study of neighborhood effects, with special attention to selection bias. We conclude with promising strategies and directions for future research, including experimental designs, taking spatial and temporal dynamics seriously, systematic observational approaches, and benchmark data on neighborhood social processes.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Depression,3822

Little is known about the specific elements of poverty that contribute to depression, particularly among African American women at risk for type 2 diabetes. This study examined the relationships of economic and social resources to depression among African American women at high risk for the development of type 2 diabetes (N = 181) using the Conservation of Resources theory as a conceptual framework. Women were assessed at 3 time points in conjunction with a dietary change intervention. At baseline, 40% of women reported clinically significant depression, and 43.3% were below the poverty line. Depressed women reported fewer economic assets and greater economic distress than nondepressed peers. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that nonwork status, lack of home ownership, low appraisal of one's economic situation, low self-esteem, and increased life events were significantly associated with depression at baseline. Longitudinal multivariate logistic regression models indicated that income, home ownership, future economic appraisal, life events, and self-esteem predicted depression trajectories at Time 3. These results speak to the multifaceted sources of stress in the lives of poor African American women. Interventions that address the economic and social factors associated with depression are needed.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Depression,51

This article explores two similar but underutilized theoretical frameworks in medical anthropology, and discusses how they facilitate new insights about the relationships between epidemiological patterns and individual-level illness experiences. Two cases from our fieldwork in New Delhi and Chicago are presented to illustrate how syndemics and chronicity theories explain the epidemic problems of co-occurring depression and type 2 diabetes. We use these case studies to illustrate how the holistic agendas of syndemics and chronicity theories allow critical scholars to attend to the macrosocial factors contributing to the rise of noncommunicable diseases while still honoring the diversity of experiences that make individual illness experiences, and actual outcomes, unique. Such an approach not only promotes a more integrative medical anthropology, but also contributes to global health dialogues around diabetes, depression, and their overlap.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Depression,82

At 18 months infant age, the home-visited infants were compared with 2 groups of socioeconomically similar unserved infants on measures of infant development, infant attachment, mother-infant interaction, maternal depression, and maternal social contacts. Home-visited infants of depressed mothers outperformed unserved infants of depressed mothers by an average of 10 points on the Bayley Mental Scale and were twice as likely to be classified as securely attached, with unserved high-risk infants showing a high rate of insecure-disorganized attachments. Duration of services was positively correlated with maternal involvement at 12 months. Results of the study point both to the negative developmental consequences associated with severe social risk conditions and to the buffering effects of developmentally oriented home-visiting services for infants at greatest social risk.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Depression,431

10.1001/archpsyc.1991.01810270035004,Depression and Anxiety in Relation to Social Status,,"• Longitudinal research in Stirling County, Atlantic Canada, indicated that during the 1950s and 1960s the prevalence of depression was significantly and persistently higher in the ""low"" socioeconomic status population than at other socioeconomic status levels. Anxiety was found to show a less clear picture. Incidence of depression after the study started was also higher among those who were initially in the low socioeconomic status group, supporting the view that the stress of poverty may be causally related to depression. There was also a trend for prior depression to be associated with subsequent downward social mobility, supporting the view that the concentration of depressed people at the lower end of the social hierarchy may result from handicapping aspects of the illness. Neither of these trends was statistically significant. More striking was evidence that, irrespective of socioeconomic status, depression carried a substantial risk for poor clinical course and outcome. Both depression and poverty tended to be chronic, and, accordingly, their association at the end of the study was influenced by their association at its beginning. The stability of the relationship between poverty and depression warrants the attention of caregivers and policymakers and raises new questions about strategies for the study of causal sequences.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Depression,226

Multiple measures of the poverty of speech construct were employed, including both clinical and quantitative indices. During the inpatient period, poverty of speech was more pronounced among depressed than schizophrenic subjects. Examination of this specific negative symptom across inpatient and followup evaluations indicated that poverty of speech increased among schizophrenic subjects, but remained relatively stable or declined among depressed subjects.

As such, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which poverty contributes to lasting risk for poor developmental outcomes. Here we use longitudinal prospectively acquired data starting in preschool to demonstrate that early poverty is associated with disruptions in developmental testosterone trajectories and hippocampal volume growth across school age and adolescent development, as well as with greater emotion dysregulation and depression in adolescence.

The present study examines the year-long prospective relationships among poverty-related stress, involuntary engagement stress response (IESR) levels, and anxiety symptoms and aggression in an ethnically diverse sample of 98 families (300 individual family members) living at or below 150% of the US federal poverty line. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) moderator model analyses provided strong evidence that IESR levels moderated the influence of poverty-related stress on anxiety symptoms and provided mixed evidence for the same interaction effect on aggression. Higher IESR levels, a proxy for physiological stress reactivity, worsened the impact of stress on symptoms. Understanding how poverty-related stress and involuntary stress responses affect psychological functioning has implications for efforts to prevent or reduce psychopathology, particularly anxiety, among individuals and families living in poverty.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Anxiety,43

One quarter of the sample were American Indian, and the remaining were predominantly white. Halfway through the study, a casino opening on the Indian reservation gave every American Indian an income supplement that increased annually.

Recent scientific advances in cognitive process models and in the neurobiology of parenting indicate that parenting is shaped in part by conscious and nonconscious cognitive processes. This study extends a growing literature on neurocognitive models of parenting by exploring the extent to which attention processes in parents operate independently and interactively with intrapsychic processes, proximal interpersonal stressors, and the larger socioeconomic context to predict perceptions of parenting hassles in primarily low-income Latino/a parents of young children living in urban areas of concentrated disadvantage (N = 185). Analyses indicated that parent reports of anxiety, intimate partner violence, and perceptions of financial hardship each uniquely predicted parents' perceptions of daily parenting hassles. Parents' attentional bias toward threat interacted with anxiety symptoms such that parents experiencing high levels of attention bias toward threat in combination with high levels of anxiety reported significantly more daily parenting hassles. Findings from the current study provide insight into the ways in which neurocognitive processes affect one aspect of parenting, with implications for programs and policies designed to support parenting for families in poverty.

Data included children's basic demographics, internalizing symptoms, and parenting process. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized model. The results demonstrated a good fit for the sample. The overall model explained 12.7% and 16.1% of the variance for children's anxiety and depression, respectively. Poverty had a significantly direct effect on children's anxiety and depression, and family social capital could partially mediate the influence of poverty on children's internalizing symptoms. Family social capital plays an important mediating role between poverty and children's mental health. Our findings provide strong evidence for social work intervention.

Generalized linear modelling is used to analyze the data. A moderation effect is found that shows the relationship between anxiety disorders and problem gambling severity varies significantly across socio-economic status. This study shows that social setting has an important influence on the assumed relationship between psychopathology and gambling problems that is downplayed in current problem gambling research.

Population-based estimates of chronic pain among U.S. adults range from 11% to 40% (5), with considerable population subgroup variation. As a result, the 2016 National Pain Strategy called for more precise prevalence estimates of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain (i.e., chronic pain that frequently limits life or work activities) to reliably establish the prevalence of chronic pain and aid in the development and implementation of population-wide pain interventions (5). National estimates of high-impact chronic pain can help differentiate persons with limitations in major life domains, including work, social, recreational, and self-care activities from those who maintain normal life activities despite chronic pain, providing a better understanding of the population in need of pain services. To estimate the prevalence of chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain in the United States, CDC analyzed 2016 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data. An estimated 20.4% (50.0 million) of U.S. adults had chronic pain and 8.0% of U.S. adults (19.6 million) had high-impact chronic pain, with higher prevalences of both chronic pain and high-impact chronic pain reported among women, older adults, previously but not currently employed adults, adults living in poverty, adults with public health insurance, and rural residents.

10.2307/2657384,The Contingent Meaning of Neighborhood Stability for Residents' Psychological Well-Being,,"nities and the individuals who live in them, and may be especially beneficial in poor neighborhoods. In contrast, a social isolation perspective proposes that neighborhood stability has negative effects on residents'psychological well-being in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. This analysis of multilevel data-data in which survey information from a representative sample of Illinois residents is linked to census-tract information about poverty and stability in their neighborhoodsupports a social isolation perspective. In affluent neighborhoods, stability is associated with low levels of distress; under conditions of poverty the opposite is true. In part this occurs because residents of poor, stable neighborhoods face high levels of disorder in their neighborhoods. Stability does not reduce perceived disorder under conditions of poverty, as it does in more affluent neighborhoods, which leaves residents feeling powerless to leave a dangerous place. Finally, the negative effects of poor, stable neighborhoods on residents'psychological well-being do not stem from a lack of social ties among neighbors. N EIGHBORHOOD stability traditionally has been heralded as a boon to quality of life, but stability's influence may not always be positive. We extend the research on neighborhood stability by showing how the benefits of stability for individual psychological well-being depend on the local economic context. We make three contributions. First, we directly assess residents' psychological distress, measured as depression and anxiety. We depart from the tradition of considering crime as the ultimate outcome and instead examine the effects of neighborhood stability and poverty on the psychological well-being of residents. Second, we examine the effects of residential stability across different types of neighborhoods because the effect of neighborhood stability on psychological well-being may depend on economic context. Third, we investigate whether physical and social disorder in the neighborhood mediates the joint effect of neighborhood stability and poverty on distress because disorder influences residents' perceptions that they are powerless to leave a threatening and dangerous environment.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Anxiety,478

I provide foundational evidence for a Good Intention Gap in political participation: Poor people want to take political action, but, consistent with the broader psychological effects of stress, financial anxiety taxes the brain’s cognitive resources. Taxed mental bandwidth and short-sighted decision-making reduce one’s capacity to follow through on intentions to participate.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Anxiety,6
10.1002/imhj.21924,"Maternal depressive symptoms, poverty, and young motherhood increase the odds of early depressive and anxiety disorders for children born prematurely",,"ABSTRACT Children born preterm, compared to term, are at risk for behavioral problems. However, the prevalence and predictors of internalizing disorders among children born preterm are unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders at 2 years of age among children born preterm and determine the extent to which poverty, maternal depressive symptoms, or young motherhood increase the likelihood of these disorders. Mothers and their infants ( N = 105) were recruited from two neonatal intensive care units affiliated with a major U.S. university. A sociodemographic questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire‐9, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition scale scores from the Preschool Child Behavior Checklist were used to measure primary variables. We examined mothers’ family satisfaction and quality of caregiving as well as children's degree of prematurity, morbidity, gender, cognitive functioning, and motor function as covariates. Fifteen percent of children met criteria for an anxiety disorder and another 15% for depression. Maternal depressive symptoms increased the odds of children developing both anxiety and depression, whereas young motherhood was associated with child anxiety and poverty with child depression. Results indicate the need for mental health assessment of children born preterm during their first 2 years of life and the importance of early therapeutic and tangible support to vulnerable mothers and children.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Anxiety,11

Subjects and their parents were interviewed on multiple occasions from 1993 to 2000 about the subjects' recent psychiatric and suicidal history. <h3>Setting</h3> An epidemiological sample of youth. <h3>Participants</h3> The sample included 1420 individual subjects with 6676 records across 8 waves of data collection. <h3>Main Outcome Measures</h3> Wanting to die, suicidal ideation, suicide plans, or suicide attempt during the past 3 months. <h3>Results</h3> Eleven broad psychiatric profiles discriminated suicidal youth. Risk was greatest in association with current depression plus anxiety (specifically GAD [generalized anxiety disorder]) (odds ratio, 468.53) or depression plus a disruptive disorder (primarily ODD [oppositional-defiant disorder]) (odds ratio, 222.94). Unless comorbid, anxiety and substance use disorders were not proximally associated with suicidality. The severity of symptom-related impairment and, in some cases, total symptom load explained risk associated with all psychiatric profiles except depression plus anxiety, specifically GAD (adjusted odds ratio, 50.16). Severity of impairment and poverty defined by federal guidelines for families were both independent risk factors, irrespective of psychiatric profile. Suicidal youth without diagnosable disorders had subthreshold (mostly disruptive) disorders, disabling relationship difficulties, or psychiatric symptoms without associated impairment. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Severity of symptom-related impairment and total symptom load explained most of the risk for suicidality associated with current psychiatric disorders. Only depression plus GAD discriminated at-risk youth independent of severity of psychopathology.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Anxiety,319

Functional status, sick days from work, and health-related quality of life (including a preference-based measure) were assessed using standardized measures adjusting for the impact of comorbid medical illnesses. Relative impact of the various anxiety disorders and major depression on these indices was evaluated.In multivariate regression analyses simultaneously adjusting for age, sex, number of chronic medical conditions, education, and/or poverty status, each of major depression, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and social phobia contributed independently and relatively equally to the prediction of disability and functional outcomes. Generalized anxiety disorder had relatively little impact on these indices when the effects of comorbid major depression were considered. Overall, anxiety disorders were associated with substantial decrements in preference-based health states.These observations demonstrate that the presence of each of 3 common anxiety disorders (ie, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and social phobia)-over and above the impact of chronic physical illness, major depression, and other socioeconomic factors-contributes in an approximately additive fashion to the prediction of poor functioning, reduced health-related quality of life, and more sick days from work. Greater awareness of the deleterious impact of anxiety disorders in primary care is warranted.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Anxiety,231

Using a longitudinal psychosocial methodology, I demonstrate how poverty can be conceptualized as a threatening 'object' to volunteer tourists, inducing unconscious anxiety by challenging Western materialistic lifestyles and identities. Volunteer tourists negotiate this anxiety in three ways: by transforming poverty into a source of moral redemption; by allowing poverty to become subsumed into a seductive, exotic landscape so that it can be admired and consumed; and by constructing impoverished communities as 'poor but happy'. It is argued that these neutralizing constructions act as barriers, preventing the intimate engagement with communities that volunteer tourism promises and lessening the potential of poverty to shock, move and even change those who come into contact with it.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Anxiety,131

Psychological distress associated with HIV infection may compound the adjustment difficulties and increase the barriers to care associated with living in poverty. The authors surveyed 100 women who were receiving HIV care at a public hospital in the southeastern United States on measures of depression, anxiety, life stress, social support, and coping; they also assessed demographic and medical characteristics of the sample. Participants' annual incomes were low (87% < $10,000), and most participants were minorities (84% African American). Their levels of depression, stress, and anxiety symptoms were elevated relative to community norms. Greater anxiety and depression symptoms were associated with women who reported higher stress, using fewer active coping strategies, and perceiving less social support (ps < .001).",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Anxiety,184

Methods: Data from 26 946 US past-year drinkers 18 years of age and over, interviewed in the 2001–2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), were used to construct multivariate linear regression models predicting six measures of drinking pattern and volume. Results: There was a consistent positive relationship between number of past-year stressors experienced and all measures of heavy drinking. Frequency of heavy (5+ drinks for men; 4+ drinks for women) drinking increased by 24% with each additional stressor reported by men and by 13% with each additional stressor reported by women. In contrast, the frequency of moderate drinking (<5 drinks for men; <4 drinks for women) decreased as stress levels increased. Job-related and legal sources of stress were more strongly associated with alcohol consumption than were social and health-related stress. Men showed a stronger association than women between the number of stressors and the most consumption measures; they also responded more strongly to the presence of any legal and job-related stress. Having an income below the poverty level intensified the effects of job-related stress, but having a mood or anxiety disorder did not affect any of the associations between stress and consumption. Conclusions: Stress does not so much lead individuals to drink more often as to substitute larger quantities of alcohol on the days when they do drink. Treatment and brief interventions aimed at problem drinkers might benefit from addressing the issue of tension alleviation and the development of alternative coping mechanisms.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Anxiety,288
10.1136/bmj.322.7285.544,Asylum seekers and refugees in Britain: Health needs of asylum seekers and refugees,,"This is the second in a series of three articles 

People who are seeking asylum are not a homogeneous population. Coming from different countries and cultures, they have had, in their own and other countries, a wide range of experiences that may affect their health and nutritional state. In the United Kingdom they face the effects of poverty, dependence, and lack of cohesive social support.1 All these factors undermine both physical and mental health. Additionally, racial discrimination can result in inequalities in health and have an impact on opportunities in and quality of life.2

Refugees' experiences also shape their acceptance and expectations of health care in the United Kingdom.3 Those from countries with no well developed primary healthcare system may expect hospital referral for conditions that in Britain are treated in primary care. This can lead to disappointment for refugees and irritation for health workers, who may also feel overwhelmed by the many and varying needs of asylum seekers, some of which are non-medical but nevertheless affect health. Addressing even a few of these needs may be of considerable benefit.

Previous studies in the United Kingdom have found that one in six refugees has a physical health problem severe enough to affect their life and two thirds have experienced anxiety or depression. 4 5 Disentangling the web of history, symptoms—which may be minimised or exaggerated for a range of reasons—and current coping mechanisms requires patience and often several sessions. Medication should be as simple as possible.

Yet there is limited evidence for interventions that prevent adolescent depression and anxiety in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 90% of adolescents live. This article introduces the ‘Improving Adolescent mentaL health by reducing the Impact of poVErty (ALIVE)’ study, its conceptual framework, objectives, methods and expected outcomes. The aim of the ALIVE study is to develop and pilot-test an intervention that combines poverty reduction with strengthening self-regulation to prevent depression and anxiety among adolescents living in urban poverty in Colombia, Nepal and South Africa. Methods This aim will be achieved by addressing four objectives: (1) develop a conceptual framework that identifies the causal mechanisms linking poverty, self-regulation and depression and anxiety; (2) develop a multi-component selective prevention intervention targeting self-regulation and poverty among adolescents at high risk of developing depression or anxiety; (3) adapt and validate instruments to measure incidence of depression and anxiety, mediators and implementation parameters of the prevention intervention; and (4) undertake a four-arm pilot cluster randomised controlled trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability and cost of the selective prevention intervention in the three study sites. Results The contributions of this study include the active engagement and participation of adolescents in the research process; a focus on the causal mechanisms of the intervention; building an evidence base for prevention interventions in LMICs; and the use of an interdisciplinary approach. Conclusions By developing and evaluating an intervention that addresses multidimensional poverty and self-regulation, ALIVE can make contributions to evidence on the integration of mental health into broader development policy and practice.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Anxiety,6

In high- and low-income countries, prior evidence linking maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms with infant LBW is conflicting. There is no research on the association between maternal mental disorders and LBW in Bangladesh. This study aims to investigate the independent effect of maternal antepartum depressive and anxiety symptoms on infant LBW among women in a rural district of Bangladesh. A population-based sample of 720 pregnant women from two rural subdistricts was assessed for symptoms of antepartum depression, using the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), and antepartum anxiety, using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and followed for 6-8 months postpartum. Infant birth weight of 583 (81%) singleton live babies born at term (≥37 weeks of pregnancy) was measured within 48 hours of delivery. Baseline data provided socioeconomic, anthropometric, reproductive, obstetric, and social support information. Trained female interviewers carried out structured interviews. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and independent-sample t tests were done as descriptive statistics, and a multiple logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of LBW. After adjusting for potential confounders, depressive (OR = 2.24; 95% CI 1.37-3.68) and anxiety (OR = 2.08; 95% CI 1.30-3.25) symptoms were significantly associated with LBW (≤2.5 kg). Poverty, maternal malnutrition, and support during pregnancy were also associated with LBW. This study provides evidence that maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy predict the LBW of newborns and replicates results found in other South Asian countries. Policies aimed at the detection and effective management of depressive and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy may reduce the burden on mothers and also act as an important measure in the prevention of LBW among offspring in Bangladesh.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Anxiety,170
10.2307/1602779,Prevalence and Effects of Child Exposure to Domestic Violence,,"In recent years, researchers have focused attention on children who are exposed to domestic violence. Although presently there are no scientifically credible estimates of the national prevalence of children exposed to domestic violence, existing data suggest that large numbers of American children are affected. This article discusses the limitations of current databases and describes a promising model for the collection of reliable and valid prevalence data, the Spousal Assault Replication Program, which uses data collected through collaboration between police and university researchers. Research examining the effects of childhood exposure to domestic violence is also limited by a range of methodological problems. Despite this, however, sufficient evidence from the body of studies exists to conclude that such exposure has adverse effects. The specific effects may differ depending on a host of variables, such as the children's ages, the nature and severity of the violence, the existence of other risk factors in the children's lives (for example, poverty, parental substance abuse), and whether the children are also directly physically abused. In general, childhood exposure to domestic violence can be associated with increased display of aggressive behavior, increased emotional problems such as depression and/or anxiety, lower levels of social competence, and poorer academic functioning. A scientifically credible body of research on the prevalence and effects of childhood exposure to domestic violence is necessary to promote the development of effective interventions and to permit the proper channeling of public and private funds.

A family stress model was examined using data from 1,142 mothers living in 2 areas of high rural poverty, focusing on the infancy through toddlerhood period. Maternal questionnaires and observations of mother-child interactions were collected across 4 time points (6, 15, 24, and 36 months). Results from structural equation analyses indicated that early economic pressure was significantly related to a variety of symptoms (depression, hostility, anxiety, and somatization), but only depression and somatization were significantly related to decreased levels of sensitive, supportive parenting behaviors. In contrast, anxiety was positively associated with sensitive parenting. Depression and anxiety were both found to mediate the relations between economic pressure and sensitive parenting behaviors. Results further suggest that mothers did not experience change in objective economic hardship over time but did experience a small decrease in economic pressure. Discussion centers on the apparent indirect influence of early economic hardship on later psychological symptoms and parenting behaviors, as well as detailing the need for broader and more complex perspectives on maternal psychological responses that arise as a result of economic disadvantage.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Anxiety,185

Important covariates were sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, marital status, years of education, household poverty, and nativity status), depressive and anxiety disorders, and number of chronic conditions. Gender related correlates were also explored. The lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempts was 8.8% and 2.5%, respectively. Female gender, family conflict, perceived discrimination, and the presence of lifetime depressive or anxiety disorders were positively correlated with suicidal ideation and attempts. A high level of identification with one's ethnic group was associated with lower rates of suicide attempts.

10.1002/ajpa.20724,Seasonal changes in household food insecurity and symptoms of anxiety and depression,,"There is growing awareness that common mental health disorders are key contributors to the burden of disease in developing countries. Studies examining the correlates of mental health have primarily been carried out in urban settings and focused on the burden rapid economic change places on individuals. In these settings, poverty and low education are consistent predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms. We argue here that these variables are proxies for insecurity, and that a more general model of symptoms of depression and anxiety should focus on locally salient forms of insecurity. Building on previous work in a seasonal subsistence setting, we identify food insecurity as a potent source of insecurity in a rural African setting, and then test whether seasonal changes in food insecurity are correlated with concomitant changes in a measure of symptoms of anxiety and depression among 173 caretakers. Results indicate that food insecurity is a strong predictor of symptoms of anxiety and depression (P < 0.0001), that changes in food insecurity across the seasons predict changes in symptoms of anxiety and depression (P < 0.0001), and that this is robust to the inclusion of covariates for material assets and household production. These results hold for individuals in both ethnic groups studied (Pimbwe and Sukuma); however, at the group level the burden falls disproportionately on Pimbwe. The results add to the growing literature on the causes of population level differences in mental health disorders and suggest new research avenues and strategies to link mental health disorders with variation in physical and biosocial outcomes.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Anxiety,129

Prior research on self-reported distress among inner-city minority children is replicated and extended among low-income, rural White children with evidence of higher levels of self- and parent-reported psychological distress, greater difficulties in self-regulatory behavior (delayed gratification), and elevated psychophysiological stress (resting blood pressure, overnight neuroendocrine hormones).

Most explanatory work on the underlying psychological processes of how poverty affects development has focused on parental investment and parenting practices, principally responsiveness. Our primary objective in this article was to describe a third, complementary pathway—chronic stress and coping—that may also prove helpful in understanding the developmental impacts of early childhood poverty throughout life. Disadvantaged children are more likely than their wealthier peers to confront a wide array of physical stressors (e.g., substandard housing, chaotic environments) and psychosocial stressors (e.g., family turmoil, separation from adult caregivers). As exposure to stressors accumulates, physiological response systems that are designed to handle relatively infrequent, acute environmental demands are overwhelmed. Chronic cumulative stressors also disrupt the self‐regulatory processes that help children cope with external demands.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Stress,761

Poverty-related stress was associated with a wide range of correlates, including internalizing and externalizing syndromes, DSM-IV diagnostic symptoms, physical health, and deviant behavior such as pregnancy, legal problems, substance abuse, and school dropout. Most models fit equally well for adolescents and preadolescents, suggesting that poverty is stressful for children as young as 6. African American children's functioning was less strongly associated with poverty-related stress than was the functioning of Hispanic and Caucasian children. Implications of poverty-related stress as a potential mechanism of poverty's pernicious effect on child functioning are discussed.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Stress,157

Exposure to chronic stressors may be one underlying mechanism for childhood poverty-health relations by influencing emotion regulatory systems. Animal work and human cross-sectional studies both suggest that chronic stressor exposure is associated with amygdala and prefrontal cortex regions important for emotion regulation. In this longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging study of 49 participants, we examined associations between childhood poverty at age 9 and adult neural circuitry activation during emotion regulation at age 24. To test developmental timing, concurrent, adult income was included as a covariate. Adults with lower family income at age 9 exhibited reduced ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity and failure to suppress amygdala activation during effortful regulation of negative emotion at age 24. In contrast to childhood income, concurrent adult income was not associated with neural activity during emotion regulation. Furthermore, chronic stressor exposure across childhood (at age 9, 13, and 17) mediated the relations between family income at age 9 and ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity at age 24. The findings demonstrate the significance of childhood chronic stress exposures in predicting neural outcomes during emotion regulation in adults who grew up in poverty.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Stress,566

This model (Wadsworth, Raviv, Santiago, & Etter, 2011 ) builds on Conger and Elder's family stress model by proposing that primary control coping and secondary control coping can help reduce the negative effects of economic strain on parental behaviors central to the family stress model, namely, parental depressive symptoms and parent-child interactions, which together can decrease child internalizing and externalizing problems. Two hundred seventy-five co-parenting couples with children between the ages of 1 and 18 participated in an evaluation of a brief family strengthening intervention, aimed at preventing economic strain's negative cascade of influence on parents, and ultimately their children. The longitudinal path model, analyzed at the couple dyad level with mothers and fathers nested within couple, showed very good fit, and was not moderated by child gender or ethnicity. Analyses revealed direct positive effects of primary control coping and secondary control coping on mothers' and fathers' depressive symptoms. Decreased economic strain predicted more positive father-child interactions, whereas increased secondary control coping predicted less negative mother-child interactions. Positive parent-child interactions, along with decreased parent depression and economic strain, predicted child internalizing and externalizing over the course of 18 months. Multiple-group models analyzed separately by parent gender revealed, however, that child age moderated father effects. Findings provide support for the adaptation to poverty-related stress model and suggest that prevention and clinical interventions for families affected by poverty-related stress may be strengthened by including modules that address economic strain and efficacious strategies for coping with strain.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Stress,69

Hierarchical linear modeling analyses conducted with 98 low-income families (300 family members: 136 adults, 82 school-aged children, 82 adolescents) revealed that primary control coping, secondary control coping, disengagement, involuntary engagement, and involuntary disengagement each significantly predicted future use of that response. Primary and secondary control coping also predicted less maladaptive future responses to stress, while involuntary responses to stress undermined the development of adaptive responding. Age, sex, and interactions among PRS and prior coping were also found to predict certain responses to stress.

Toxic stress—the results of exposure to adverse childhood experiences—results in changes to brain structure and function that negatively affects future health. Objectives The aim of this study was to apply the eco-bio-developmental (EBD) model of poverty and preterm birth to the cross-sectional data of the 2016 National Survey of Children’s Health to evaluate the associations between poverty, toxic stress, and prematurity on neurodevelopmental and educational outcomes. Methods A subset of data representing children ages 6–11 years old ( n = 15,010) from the 2016 National Survey of Children’s Health was used for multivariate analysis of demographic variables and neurodevelopmental and educational outcome variables. Pearson’s chi-square, logistic regression, and interaction effects explored the relationships between prematurity, toxic stress, and poverty. Results Children in this sample born preterm had a higher incidence of toxic stress, poverty, developmental delay, learning disability, intellectual disability, speech/language disorders, attention-deficit disorder (ADD)/attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, and special education/early intervention plans. The combination of poverty, toxic stress, and preterm birth significantly increased the risk of these conditions. After accounting for gender, insurance coverage, race, and parental education, children in the sample born preterm were more likely to experience developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech/language disorder, learning disability, and ADD/ADHD. Toxic stress increased the incidence of ADD/ADHD and autism in both the preterm and full-term samples. Discussion The negative effect of poverty and toxic stress on children born preterm, as depicted by the eco-bio-developmental model, is supported by this analysis.

Currently, there are no studies on the association between ACEs and adults' subjective experiences of stress in the parenting role, where socioeconomic status (SES)−related poverty effects have been controlled for--the central question behind the current study. We examined exposure to ACEs among 118 mothers (n = 33 low SES/impoverished and n = 85 middle/high SES) and parenting distress. Participants completed an ACE questionnaire that assessed exposure to 10 adverse experiences from childhood (e.g., abuse, neglect, household dysfunction), and the Parenting Stress Index−Short Form. Parenting distress and ACEs were significantly higher in the low SES group; yet, even after controlling for SES, higher ACE scores added significant explained variance in parental distress in a linear regression model. DISCUSSION focuses on the need to administer ACE screening in prenatal and pediatric settings to identify and to offer trauma- and attachment-informed treatment, so to reduce the intergenerational transmission of risk associated with problematic parenting.

A total of 750 telephone interviews were conducted with 75 parents concerning their daily stressors and strategies they used to help children cope. A behavioral protocol measured child learned helplessness. Multilevel modeling showed a positive within‐persons relationship between daily stress and coping, and a positive between‐persons relationship between daily stress and child learned helplessness. Implications include understanding the daily processes through which the poverty ecology transmits risk for negative child developmental outcomes and through which parents might offer protection. Specifically, the results suggest that daily poverty‐related stressors may undermine young children's developing sense of control and suggest the importance of further research on how parent coping might promote positive outcomes.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Stress,19

Specifically, it was proposed that social support and self-efficacy are psychological resources that are associated with lower parenting stress levels, and would moderate the impact of family income on parenting stress. A significant proportion of variance in parenting stress was explained by self-efficacy, family risk, and the interaction of self-efficacy and family income; family income alone was not a significant predictor of parenting stress levels. Mothers higher in self-efficacy had lower levels of parenting stress, and income was less associated with parenting stress levels for mothers high in self-efficacy. Social support was not associated with lower parenting stress levels, nor did social support moderate the effect of income on parenting stress. Family risk was also a strong and reliable predictor of parenting stress, suggesting that family circumstances are perhaps better predictors of parenting stress levels than income alone.

Here, we use findings from research in two low‐income communities in south‐west England to examine how these narratives become embodied within people's daily lives when they intersect with systems of welfare support and the current political drive to upscale treatment for common mental health conditions. Drawing on Bourdieu's notion of symbolic violence, we examine how narratives of self‐responsibility and associated welfare reform strategies impact on the mental health of people living in economic hardship. The data show how such narratives inflict, sustain and exacerbate mental distress and suffering, and how they become naturalised and normalised by individuals themselves. We demonstrate how this situation pushes people to seek support from General Practitioners, and how clinical interactions can normalise, and in turn, medicalise, poverty‐related distress. Whilst some people actively resist dominant narratives around self‐responsibility, we argue that this is insufficient under broader sociocultural and political circumstances, to free themselves from the harms perpetuated by symbolic violence.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Stress,21

Multigroup path analysis tested moderation by gender and race/ethnicity.Path analysis revealed that PRS was indirectly associated with higher depressive symptoms through less social support and less use of engagement coping operating in parallel and sequentially in a three-path mediated sequence. Conversely, EI was indirectly associated with lower depressive symptoms through greater social support and greater use of engagement coping operating in parallel and sequentially. However, PRS remained a direct predictor of higher depressive symptoms. Moderation by gender and race/ethnicity was not found.Overall, the findings provide empirical support for the APRS model. This study suggests that clinical and preventive interventions targeting depression in low-income parents could benefit from focusing on improving low-income parent's use of engagement coping and perceived social support.

However, these studies are confined largely to middle‐class and general populations. We extend what is known by examining how the unique stressors and forms of social support experienced by women in poverty impact alcohol problems over a 4‐year time‐period. Design, setting and participants This prospective study used generalized estimating equations (GEE) transition modeling and four annual waves of survey data from 392 American mothers receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) in a large Northern California county. Measurements We examined the effects of neighborhood disorder, stressful life events and economic hardship on psychological distress and problem drinking over time, and whether social support moderated these relationships for women in poverty. Findings Neighborhood disorder and stressful life events increased significantly the risk for problem drinking, largely through their effect on psychological distress. We found little evidence, however, that social support buffers poor women from the effects of these stressors. Conclusions Women in poverty are exposed to severe, chronic stressors within their communities and immediate social networks which increase vulnerability to psychological distress and problem drinking. The finding that social support does not buffer stress among these women may reflect their high level of exposure to stressors, as well as the hardships and scarce resources within their networks. If the ‘private safety net’ of the social network fails to provide a strong buffer, more effective environmental interventions that reduce exposure to stressors may be needed to prevent alcohol problems in poor women's lives.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Stress,139

In contrast, lower social class was associated with more other-oriented feelings of compassion and love, and with greater awe. There were no class differences in enthusiasm. We discuss that individuals from different social class backgrounds may exhibit different patterns of emotional responding due to their distinct social concerns and priorities.

In March 2017, the Province of Special Region of Yogyakarta (DIY Province) has poverty line of IDR 374,009, percentage of poor people (13.03%) and Gini index (0.432) above the national average (IDR 374,478; 10.64%; 0.393). The result of happiness index in 2017 shows the position of DIY Province (72.93%) is above average of national happiness index (70.69%). Scatterplot between happiness index and percentage of poor people in Indonesia in 2017 shows that DIY Province is on first quadrant. This marks the high level of happiness along with high percentage of poor people. Small area estimation method developed by Elbers et al (known as ELL method) is used to determine spatial characteristics of poverty and happiness profiles in DIY Province. This study used village census data (Podes) 2018; Susenas March 2017 and SPTK 2017 as survey data. There are twenty three household variables and another five variables that are significant to poverty and happiness models at urban and rural provincial level. Rural regency areas dominates high poverty profile (FGT0 0.0491 – 0.1076), low happiness profile (FTG0 0.0087 – 0.0124), and inequality of happiness profile (Gini index 0.0847 – 0.0923). Urban regency areas dominates low poverty profile (FTG0 0.0082 – 0.0491), high happiness profile (FTG0 0 – 0.0087), and perfect equality of both income (Gini index 0.3048 – 0.3604) and happiness profiles (Gini index 0.0624 – 0.0847). Yogyakarta City has happiest and wealthies profiles, whereas Gunung Kidul regency urban area has perfect equality of both income and happiness profiles.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Happiness,1

By relational goods we indicate the affective/expressive, non instrumental, side of interpersonal relationships. The homo oeconomicus view of human nature is questioned by the recent upsurge of empirical studies on the determinants of self declared happiness, that show that an increasing income does not always lead to more subjective well being ( Easterlin's famous (1974) ‘paradox of happiness’). The theoretical literature on relational goods has isolated various mechanisms which may induce an under‐consumption and under‐ production of relational goods. The hypothesis we test is that people with a more intense relational life are less affected by this ‘relational poverty trap’ and are therefore happier. Our findings does not disprove our hypothesis: relational goods turn out to have significant and positive effects on self declared life satisfaction, when other determinants isolated in the literature as important are taken into account and when the inverse causality nexus i.e. from more happiness to a more intense relational life is also taken into account. Finally, we show that gender, age and education matter and in particular that the effects of sociability on happiness are stronger for women, older and less educated individuals. These findings can be useful in designing and evaluating public policies with a direct or indirect effect on the quality and quantity of relational goods.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Happiness,333

In the first section, ""ontology, poverty and Catholicism,"" I will attempt to lay out the basic parameters of a Catholic approach to the human person and the subsequent implications of that approach for understanding the question of poverty. In the second section, ""liberalism, poverty and welfare in the U.S.,"" I will juxtapose the Catholic approach with what is arguably the dominate orientation toward the human person and his or her relationship to property and wealth in the United States of America as derived from a certain brand of liberalism. In the third section, ""poverty, religion and human rights in the U.S.,"" I will try to make the case in the context of the history of the American welfare state and recent developments in the area of welfare reform, that the current consensus and mode of discourse surrounding poverty and welfare in the United States stands in direct opposition to the most fundamental aspects of Christianity in general and the social teachings of Catholicism in particular. More specifically, I will argue that the contemporary approach to poverty and welfare engendered in legislation like Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF) and the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) represent at their root a fundamental violation of the most basic of all God-given human rights, namely to give one's self in agapic love to the Other. If that argument is made successfully, the implication regarding the approach to welfare in the United States will be that the public policy that sustains such a violation it is at least partially reflective of what is now called a structure of sin. In turn, serious Christians are then called to confront and work to change its nature in the name of their faith.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Happiness,3

Overall, the urban poor are higher in perceived health than the rural poor, although no differences are apparent in happiness or depression. Significant interactions are present between rural/urban poverty and sex, race, and family status. The psychological well-being of poor African Americans is higher in rural than urban areas, whereas the well-being of poor whites is higher in urban than rural areas. This trend is especially pronounced for depression among males. In addition, single men without children have especially high depression scores in rural areas, whereas married women without children have especially low depression scores in urban areas. The results are interpreted in terms of the environmental quality of inner-city neighborhoods and attitudes toward poverty in urban and rural communities.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Happiness,131
10.1080/00220380903012763,The Rural–Urban Divide in China: Income but Not Happiness?,,"Abstract The paper presents subjective well-being functions for urban and rural China, based on a national household survey for 2002. Whereas the vast income disparity between urban and rural households is confirmed, it is found that, remarkably, rural households report higher subjective well-being than do their richer urban counterparts. A decomposition analysis explores the reasons for this reversal. It finds that there are many determinants of happiness other than absolute income, and that the determinants differ in the two sectors. An explanation for the puzzle is advanced in terms of relative concepts, income inequalities, orbits of comparison, and degrees of insecurity. Positive and normative implications are discussed.

In multivariable logistic regression, lowest-quartile happiness was associated with poverty, unfavorable subjective health, debilitating pain and urinary incontinence, but not with the comorbidity count or other comorbidities. The results, robust to common method bias, suggest that subjective health measures are better predictors of happiness than objective measures are, except for conditions that disrupt daily functioning or are associated with social stigma.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Happiness,113

This investigation examines the relationship between goal-striving stress and mental health in a national sample of black Americans. Results indicate that goal-striving stress is significantly related to lower levels of happiness, life satisfaction, self-esteem, and higher levels of psychological distress. We find that poverty status moderates the relationship between goal-striving stress and mental health. Compared to poorer persons, individuals above poverty with high goal-striving stress have significantly lower levels of happiness and life satisfaction. Overall, the findings provide a more complete context for understanding associations among socioeconomic status, goal-striving stress, and adverse mental health outcomes among black Americans.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Happiness,119

The article recommends that further research explore the connections between these indicators, as well as their relationship with objective measures of disadvantage. While reaffirming that perceptual states should not be treated as aims of government policy, it is argued that they may provide a richer understanding of peoples' values and behavior—and therefore that further research on the subject could deepen our understanding of capability poverty.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Happiness,191

But it had not yet been tested whether it is urbanism that negatively affects happiness, or if urban problems such as crime and poverty are to blame. Wirth posited that urbanism itself led to negative effects, but Fischer noted the necessity of empirical tests of Wirth’s ideas. This study uses a happiness measure to provide a new look at the old question of urban unhappiness. Using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we aim to untangle the effects of the city itself and urban problems on happiness in the USA.

Both FS and LS thus have limited, if any, adaptation. Implications are discussed for economics and psychology theories and policies.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Happiness,1

Muhammad Yunus, the practical visionary who pioneered microcredit and, with his Grameen Bank, won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for his world-changing efforts, here develops his bold new concept that promises to revolutionize the free-enterprise system: social business. Designed to fill the gap between profit-making and human needs, social business applies entrepreneurial thinking to problems like poverty, hunger, pollution, and disease, creating self-supporting, self-replicating enterprises that create jobs and generate economic growth even as they provide goods and services that make the world a better place. Partnering with some of the world's greatest corporations, Yunus and Grameen Bank have already launched several social businesses that are addressing challenges like malnutrition, lack of potable water, and endemic illness in Yunus' homeland of Bangladesh, and other organizations around the world are developing their own experiments in social business. In this book, Yunus traces the development of the social business idea; explains its lessons for entrepreneurs, social activists, and policy makers; offers practical guidance for those who want to create social businesses of their own; and, shows why social business holds the potential to redeem the failed promise of free enterprise.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self concept,552

It allows comparisons of the level and trend of poverty and inequality across several nations, along with considerable detail on the sources of market incomes and public policies that shape these outcomes.

This paper seeks to unfold and re-think this informal/formal conception using two interconnected theoretical frameworks. First is assemblage theory derived from the work of Deleuze and Guattari, in which a series of twofold concepts such as rhizomic/tree and smooth/striated resonate with the informal/formal construct. Second is theory on complex adaptive systems, in which dynamic and unpredictable patterns of self-organisation emerge with certain levels of resilience or vulnerability. These approaches are drawn together into the concept of a complex adaptive assemblage, illustrated with brief snapshots of urban informality drawn from Southeast Asian cities.

Data were collected from young adults studying at university. The sample comprised 252 participants whose ages ranged between 17 and 35 and who were studying on different programs at university. Of the participants, 155 (61%) were female and 97 were male (39%) students. The scenario sample used in the prototype analyses was used as the data collection instrument. The data were analyzed by means of a prototype analysis method in order to identify the concept of dependency in interpersonal relationships and dependent relationships. As a result of the prototype analysis, three different head categories and 71 features were identified. The tables demonstrate these features in rank order in terms of representing the category in the best way.  These categories are defined as, a) interpersonal dependency, b) dependent individuals’ characteristics and c) indicators of a dependent relationship. Showing love, trust building and giving arm emerged as the prototype of interpersonal dependency concept. Inability to act by oneself, anxiety, lack of confidence, self-denial and being open to indoctrination emerged as the prototype of dependent personal characteristics. Inability to live without the dependable person, feeling the constant need to be near him/her, desire to satisfy him/her, placing that person in the center of one's life, and the need to be informed about that person also emerged as the prototype of a dependent relationship. It was found out that the prototype of dependency in interpersonal relationships and the prototype of dependent relationship indicators comprise both positive and negative characteristics. It is observed that the prototype of dependent individual characteristics is generally perceived negatively.

Non-governmental organisations and development practitioners are increasingly focusing their attention on strategies which build upon local knowledge, skills and resources. The concepts of ‘self- reliance’ and local economic development are examined in the context of development challenges which face Africa. This is followed by a detailed case study of local economic development in the rural Mpofu District of the former Ciskei Homeland, which was incorporated into the Eastern Cape province of South Africa with the demise of apartheid in 1994.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self concept,104

Due to poverty and high unemployment, some girls aspire to early marriage. Two pathways to early marriage are identified: first, poverty and gendered economic disparities motivate girls to begin transactional sexual activity at an early age, leading parents to favour early marriage as a risk-reduction measure. Second, educational opportunities are often closed off to girls before marriage, as a result of which early marriage becomes the only culturally approved pathway that allows girls to present themselves to others as a self-sufficient agent. These pathways are reinforced by cultural and religious concepts surrounding the transition from childhood to adulthood. The study finds that, in urban Tanzania, two important factors associated with early marriage are the prevalence of premarital sex leading to out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and the relatively high cost of secondary schooling, which blocks educational opportunities for girls after the age of 15.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self concept,101
10.2167/laic252.0,"Authenticity, Culture and Language Learning",,"In philosophy, authenticity has been used with two meanings: one entails the notion of correspondence; the other entails the notion of genesis (Cooper, 1983: 15). As in certain branches of philosophy, language teaching has perhaps clung too long to the first of these notions of authenticity at the expense of the other. This paper reviews four key conceptualisations of authenticity which have emerged in the field of applied linguistics: text authenticity, authenticity of language competence, learner authenticity and classroom authenticity. If any of these types of authenticity is couched exclusively in terms of one usage or the other, it can lead to an impoverishment and objectification of the experience of language learning. Text authenticity can lead to a poverty of language; authenticity of competence can lead to a poverty of performance; learner authenticity can lead to a poverty of interpretation; classroom authenticity can lead to a poverty of communication. This paper proposes that a pedagogy of intercultural communication be informed by a more hybrid view of authenticity as a process of subjectification, derived from the Heideggerian concept of self-concern.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self concept,77
10.1002/mar.20254,The impact of branding on low‐income adolescents: A vicious cycle?,,"Abstract This study examines the impact of consumerism and consumer culture on low‐income British adolescents. Specifically, it investigates the effects of branding and advertising on the formation of selfconcept clarity (SCC) and consumer susceptibility to interpersonal influence (CSII). A comparative study was conducted between two groups, low‐ and high‐income teenagers, assessing SCC and CSII by means of quantitative scales. It was found that low‐income teenagers are less clear in their self‐concept and are more susceptible to interpersonal influence than their high‐income counterparts. A significant negative correlation between the two scales revealed that the less clear one's self‐concept is, the more susceptible one is to interpersonal influence. It is proposed that an inability to “keep up” with the latest fashion trends (due to restricted consumption opportunities) may result in a damaged self‐concept among low‐income teenagers, which leads to heightened susceptibility to consumption pressures and hence heightens the negative socio‐psychological impacts of living in poverty. The results of the study are reviewed in terms of branding, advertising, and consumer behavior and a proposed conceptual model of branding's impact on low‐income teenagers is presented as a “vicious cycle.” © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self concept,78

This randomized controlled trial examined whether an interactive virtual poverty simulation created in Second Life ® would improve nursing students’ empathy with and attributions for people living in poverty, compared to a self-study module. We created a multi-user virtual environment populated with families and individual avatars that represented the demographics contributing to poverty and vulnerability. Participants ( N = 51 baccalaureate nursing students) were randomly assigned to either Intervention or Control groups and completed the modified Attitudes toward Poverty Scale pre- and post-intervention. The 2.5-hour simulation was delivered three times over a 1-year period to students in successive community health nursing classes. The investigators conducted post-simulation debriefings following a script. While participants in the virtual poverty simulation developed significantly more favorable attitudes on five questions than the Control group, the total scores did not differ significantly. Whereas students readily learned how to navigate inside Second Life ® , faculty facilitators required periodic coaching and guidance to be competent. While poverty simulations, whether virtual or face-to-face, have some ability to transform nursing student attitudes, faculty must incorporate social justice concepts throughout the curriculum to produce lasting change.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self concept,71

Crucially, neoliberal policy‐makers found the microcredit concept ideologically compelling, and the international development community soon began to provide massive support to establish and expand the microfinance movement. Today, however, even long‐standing microfinance advocates now reluctantly accept that microcredit has actually had no positive impact upon poverty or ‘bottom‐up’ rural development. In fact, those rural communities most exposed to microcredit have been severely damaged in a number of ways, especially through sub‐prime‐style ‘boom‐to‐bust’ episodes. Largely because of its supreme ideological usefulness, the microfinance movement nonetheless still retains some support in the major neoliberal‐oriented international development institutions, pro‐globalization think‐tanks, and in a number of Western governments.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self concept,77

10.1080/17502970903086719,"Becoming Liberal, Unbecoming Liberalism: Liberal-Local Hybridity via the Everyday as a Response to the Paradoxes of Liberal Peacebuilding",,"Abstract Abstract It has become clear that the liberal international institutions and ‘corridors of power’ have so far failed to deliver on their promise of a liberal peace for all. Liberal peacebuilding has often offered resources to an elaborate structuration of sometimes predatory elites – international and local – but not to the general populations of these multiple states. Institutions have been created, but the reach of liberal politics has had little impact – other than in basic security and in rhetorical, rights oriented terms – on the everyday life of populations. The local is commonly deployed to depict a homogenous and disorderly Other, whose needs and aspirations do not conform to liberal standards. Claims that moves toward the everyday have already been made disguise the limited ambitions of liberal statebuilders to enable a real improvement in local agency. In the midst of all of this the real everyday needs and lives of individuals have become obscured. This essay briefly suggests some theoretical responses, via the concepts of the ‘everyday’ and ‘empathy’. These offer the possibility of placing the social contract back within the heart of post-conflict states, or of allowing a new, post-liberal, politics which is more locally ‘authentic’, resonant and agential, to emerge. Keywords: liberal peaceeverydayempathylocal-liberalhybridity Acknowledgements Thanks to Kristopher Liden, Peter Burgess and Sharhbanou Tadjbakhsh, as well as to Michael Pugh, Roger Mac Ginty, Nick Rengger, Vivienne Jabri and Rob Walker. Thanks also to Roland Bleiker, John Heathershaw and Tony Lang. Two anonymous reviewers also helped me clarify some aspects of this essay. All errors remain my own responsibility. Notes 1. Recent iterations of peacebuilding and statebuilding have attempted to follow an underlying model, inherent in various Western-centric debates about liberalism and neoliberalism. It is this model which is used to evaluate the progress made in building states, and which often shows such states to be ‘failed’ or ‘failing’ when they do not meet such prescriptions. 2. Henceforth, I use the term ‘the local’ to denote what international actors normally perceive as a range of actors and terrains spanning their non-Western and non-liberal partners for liberal peacebuilding and statebuilding at the elite level (whilst also acknowledging that many partners may have extensive transnational experience of liberal politics) and civil society. I use the term ‘local-local’ to indicate the existence and diversity of communities and individuals that constitute political society beyond this often liberally projected artifice. This latter is where the everyday is at its most powerful as a critical tool. 3. ‘The PRS approach has been to focus attention on country-specific constraints to development. In many low-income countries the PRS initiative has also resulted in a sharper focus on poverty reduction, a more open participatory process and greater attention to monitoring poverty-related outcomes.’ When seen from the perspective of the everyday such claims are hardly convincing and progress in moving beyond institutional structures and elite-level projects and debates, while underway, is very slow (see World Bank and the International Monetary Fund 2004 World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . 2004 . Poverty reduction strategy papers – progress in implementation . Prepared by the staffs of the World Bank and the IMF approved by Gobind Nankani (World Bank) and Mark Allen (IMF), 20 September . [Google Scholar]). 4. Lack of space means that I cannot provide empirical examples to illustrate these theoretical arguments here. For empirical support for, and detail of, my arguments see my Liberal Peace Transitions (2009). 5. This has been my experience in fieldwork conducted around the world, though while there has been a growing realization of such issues in policy praxis, there has been a certain level of self-censorship in such circles. 6. Even though I have found that UN and World Bank officials regularly acknowledge these issues, there is still a great reluctance to engage with them and move beyond the standard operating procedures of current liberal praxis. 7. Erasmus believed that rulers were often responsible for war, and that a political system was required to prevent them from opposing the wishes of their subjects. He believed that rulers should not treat their territories as private property and should be concerned with the welfare of others. He believed speaking and praising peace and condemning war should be normal social practice as well as state practice. 8. This was, for example, highlighted in the speech by Mr Chevallier, assistant to the French Foreign Minister, Bernard Kouchner, at a conference discussing the track record of liberal peacebuilding, at Sciences Po, Paris in June 2008. 9. For instance UN, EU and OECD DAC guidelines for peacebuilding now often make reference to needs, human security, human rights, civil society, the local and the customary. 10.

10.5840/beq201323326,The Poor as Suppliers of Intellectual Property: A Social Network Approach to Sustainable Poverty Alleviation,,"ABSTRACT: We extend the Base of the Pyramid (BoP) poverty-alleviation approach by recognizing the poor as valuable suppliers—specifically of intellectual property. Although the poor possess huge reserves of intellectual property, they are unable to participate in global knowledge networks owing to their illiteracy and poverty. This is a crippling form of social exclusion in today’s growing knowledge economy because it adversely affects their capabilities for advancement at several levels. Providing the poor access to global knowledge networks as rightful participants—as suppliers of intellectual property—leads to poverty alleviation as a result of their increased social inclusion, not only through economic benefits, but also through the poor’s improved well-being as a result of their increased self-esteem and dignity. Using concepts from social network theory, we develop a poverty-alleviation approach to harness and integrate the intellectual property of the poor into global knowledge networks through trust-based partnerships among the poor, non-governmental organizations, and multinational corporations.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self concept,56
10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01611,Estimating the Epidemiology and Quantifying the Damages of Parental Separation in Children and Adolescents,,"Parental separation is linked to multiple negative outcomes for children in all spheres of life. A field study was designed to estimate the epidemiology and to quantify the outcomes on the wellbeing of children from separated parents. Thus, data on socio-economic status, psychological adjustment, behavioural disorders, social relations, self-concept, and academic achievement were gathered from 346 children and adolescents, 173 separated parents, and 173 parents from intact families in the paediatric catchment area of Galicia (Spain). The results showed that parental separation had a significant negative impact on the children's and adolescents' family income (increasing the probability of falling below the poverty line); psychological adjustment (i.e., higher scores in anxiety, depression, hostility, paranoid ideation and interpersonal alienation); social relations (i.e., less self-control in social relations; higher social withdrawal); self-concept (lower levels of academic, emotional, physical and family self-concept), and academic achievement (lower academic achievement with higher school dropout rates). Moreover, children from separated families had a higher probability of being exposed to gender violence. Epidemiologically, parental separation is associated to the probability of falling below the poverty line 33.9%; being exposed to gender violence 43.2%; and symptoms such as depression, anxiety, hostility, paranoid ideation interpersonal alienation, and social withdrawal i.e., 20, 17, 27, 20, 19%, and 35.5%, respectively. Inversely, self-control in social relations, and academic, emotional, physical, and family self-concept fell to 16, 32, 27, 22%, and 37%, respectively. The interrelationship among these variables and the implications of these results for interventions are discussed.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self concept,48
10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00061,Neuroscience of Childhood Poverty: Evidence of Impacts and Mechanisms as Vehicles of Dialog With Ethics,,"Several studies have identified associations between poverty and development of self-regulation during childhood, which is broadly defined as those skills involved in cognitive, emotional, and stress self-regulation. These skills are influenced by different individual and contextual factors at multiple levels of analysis (i.e., individual, family, social, and cultural). Available evidence suggests that the influences of those biological, psychosocial, and sociocultural factors on emotional and cognitive development can vary according to the type, number, accumulation of risks, and co-occurrence of adverse circumstances that are related to poverty, the time in which these factors exert their influences, and the individual susceptibility to them. Complementary, during the past three decades, several experimental interventions that were aimed at optimizing development of self-regulation of children who live in poverty have been designed, implemented, and evaluated. Their results suggest that it is possible to optimize different aspects of cognitive performance and that it would be possible to transfer some aspects of these gains to other cognitive domains and academic achievement. We suggest that it is an important task for ethics, notably but not exclusively neuroethics, to engage in this interdisciplinary research domain to contribute analyses of key concepts, arguments, and interpretations. The specific evidence that neuroscience brings to the analyses of poverty and its implications needs to be spelled out in detail and clarified conceptually, notably in terms of causes of and attitudes toward poverty, implications of poverty for brain development, and for the possibilities to reduce and reverse these effects.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self concept,47

The article presents a historical review of the transracial adoption controversy, detailing the arguments that have been presented in opposition and the legislation that has evolved. Symbolic interactionism is used to frame African Americans as a unique and distinct cultural group, in which the socialization of African American children takes place. The framework presented encompasses the meaning of children, family, and adoption to people of African descent, the racial and ethnic group as the context within which definitions of self and identity develop, and the efforts made in seeking to balance the integrity of concepts such as Baldwin's African self-consciousness with the values and goals of the larger U.S. society. Finally, the author makes recommendations to social workers for developing a research agenda that maintains but critically analyzes the role of African American group identity for framing research for assessing child maltreatment within the context of poverty and resource deficiencies rather than personal failures and for advocating public policies that preserve cultural realities.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self concept,69
10.1080/10796120120038028,"Schooling, tracking, and inequality",,"Being poor does not only mean that a child has less money and fewer toys. Poverty is pervasive. It affects diet, nutrition, employment, housing, self-concept, and the entire educational experience. Ironically, Americans have always looked to education as a means of breaking the seemingly endless cycle of poverty. But rather than serve as a great ladder carrying all who climb with concerted effort to social and economic equality, current research suggests some educational structures may actually limit opportunities for certain children. This paper focuses on education in American society and how it may influence inequality . It addresses the question of why students from various social classes differ significantly in academic achievement and it critiques the major theoretical explanations for this difference. Finally, it supports the idea that specific educational structures perpetuate the cycle of poverty by determining educational outcomes and limiting the economic life chances of children. One such educational structure, tracking, or separation by ability, is the focus of this paper. Tracking is a reality in the American school system. Considerable research has revealed class, gender, and race biases with less-advantaged children more often placed in the lower tracks. This paper examines tracking on a national and international basis. It explores various processes within the tracks that limit a child's development and, in turn, have an impact on future economic opportunities. In sum, it examines how tracking may perpetuate the endless cycle of poverty.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self concept,59
10.14989/70892,Islamic Microfinance: A Missing Component in Islamic Banking,,"Microfinance means “programme that extend small loans to very poor people for self employment projects that generate income in allowing them to take care of themselves and their families” (Microcredit Summit, 1997). The World Bank has recognized microfinance programme as an approach to address income inequalities and poverty. The microfinance scheme has been proven to be successful in many countries in addressing the problems of poverty. The World Bank has also declared 2005 as the year of microfinance with the aim to expand their poverty eradication campaign. The main aim of the paper is to assess the potentials of Islamic financing schemes for micro financing purposes. The paper argues that Islamic finance has an important role for furthering socio-economic development of the poor and small (micro) entrepreneurs without charging interest (read: riba’). Furthermore, Islamic financing schemes have moral and ethical attributes that can effectively motivate micro entrepreneurs to thrive. The paper also argues that there is a nexus between Islamic banking and microfinance as many elements of microfinance could be considered consistent with the broader goals of Islamic banking. The paper, first, introduces the concepts of microfinance, and presents a case for Islamic microfinance to become one of the components of Islamic banking. The paper then discusses, the potentials of various Islamic financing schemes that can be advanced and adapted from microfinance purposes including techniques to mitigate the inherent risks. Finally, the paper concludes with the proposals to accommodate the Islamic microfinance within the present Islamic banking structure. 2. Principles of Microfinance Microfinance grew out of experiments in Latin America and South Asia, but the best known start was in Bangladesh in 1976, following the wide-spread famine in 1974. Advocates argue that the microfinance movement has helped to reduce poverty, improved schooling levels, and generated or expanded millions of small businesses. The idea of microfinance has now spread globally, with replications in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and Eastern Europe, as well as richer economies like Norway, the United States, and England. Among the features of microfinance is disbursement of small size loan to the recipients that are normally micro entrepreneurs and the poor. The loan is given for the purpose of new income generating project or business expansion. The terms and conditions of the loan are normally easy to understand and flexible. It is provided for short term financing and repayments can be made on a weekly or longer basis. The procedures and processes of loan disbursements are normally fast and easy. Additional capital can also be given after the full settlement of the previous loan.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self concept,138
10.1111/1475-4991.00021,"The “Inability to be Self‐Reliant” as an Indicator of Poverty: Trends for the U.S., 1975–97",,"In this paper we present a new concept of poverty, Self‐Reliant poverty, which is based on the ability of a family, using its own resources, to support a level of consumption in excess of needs. This concept closely parallels the “capability poverty” measure that has been proposed by Amartya Sen. We use this measure to examine the trend and composition of the Self‐Reliant poor population from 1975 to 1997. We find that Self‐Reliant poverty has increased more rapidly over this period than has official poverty. Families considered to be the most vulnerable—those headed by minorities, single women with children, and individuals with low levels of education—have the highest levels of Self‐Reliant poverty. However, these groups have also experienced the smallest increases in poverty. Conversely, families largely thought to be economically secure—those headed by whites, married men with children, and highly educated individuals—have the lowest levels of Self‐Reliant poverty, but have experienced the largest increases in poverty. We also find that the Self‐Reliant poor is increasingly composed of vulnerable groups relative to the composition of the official poor. The labor market, demographic, and policy sources of the divergent trends in Self‐Reliant and official poverty, and of the gender, race and family structure changes in poverty rates are explored.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self concept,35

The design was a qualitative study using focus group discussion. Four focus groups of South Asian women (using existing women's groups in Manchester, UK) formed the setting for this study. Each focus group was facilitated by one of the authors, and the discussions occurred in Urdu, English and Punjabi. An interview guide was used, although the direction of the discussions followed the women's agenda. Notes were taken during the focus group discussions. Analysis of notes to define themes and emergence of framework was carried out. The data were analysed according to the principles of framework analysis. A range of systemic issues were described by respondents including: social, political and economic pressures; domestic violence; poverty; language problems; family and children's issues; and health. These experiences were reinforced by an extremely efficient community grapevine and were evident in described experiences such as: racism and stereotyping of Asian women; Asian communities and Islam; and the concept of izzat (honour) in Asian family life, which was seen as a major influence in the lives of Asian women. These experiences were thought to result in mental distress, which was described in a variety of ways by the women. The women saw self-harm as a usable coping strategy to deal with their distress. Perceived barriers to services were described by the women. Services tended to be accessed only at a point of desperation, rather than prior to crisis points. This indicated the need for services to be able to respond rapidly when Asian women did ask for help. Whilst the present paper describes a local study, thus limiting its generalisability, the use of such work in commissioning local health and social services is outlined. A number of indicators for good practice were drawn up in relation to addressing systemic issues in service provision using these findings. Such indicators will be of use by primary care trusts in developing, commissioning and monitoring services for this patient group.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self concept,115
10.1002/jid.784,"The World Development Report: concepts, content and a Chapter 12*",,"Abstract The World Development Report (WDR) process set new standards for openness and consultation. Its concepts and content are a major advance on its 1990 predecessor. The intention that its concepts and content should be influenced by voices of the poor was partly fulfilled. Conceptually, the VOP findings support the multidimensional view of poverty as ‘pronounced deprivation of wellbeing’, and the use of income‐poverty to describe what is only one dimension of poverty (though this welcome usage is not consistent throughout in the WDR). Two concepts or analytical orientations were not adopted: powerlessness and disadvantage seen as a multidimensional interlinked web; and livelihoods. On content, three areas where the influence fell short were: how the police persecute and impoverish poor people; the diversity of the poorest people; and the significance of the body as the main but vulnerable and indivisible asset of many poor people. A weakness of the WDR is its lack of critical self‐awareness. Chapter 11 is self‐serving for the International Financial Institutions: it lumps loans with grants as concessional finance; it makes liberal use of the term donor, but never lender; and it does not consider debt avoidance as a strategy. The Report ends abruptly, a body without a head. Its multidimensional view of poverty is not matched by a multidimensional view of power and responsibility. A Chapter 12 is crying out to be written. This would confront issues of professional, institutional and personal commitment and change. It would stress critical reflection as a professional norm, disempowerment for democratic diversity as institutional practice, and personal values, attitudes and courageous behaviour as primary and crucial if development is to be change that is good for poor people. A new conclusion is suggested for the WDR, and a title for the World Development Report 2010. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self concept,38

10.1002/hbm.23273,Pathway to neural resilience: Self‐esteem buffers against deleterious effects of poverty on the hippocampus,,"Human neuroimaging studies have shown that people living in poverty tend to suffer hippocampal atrophy, which leads to impaired memory and learning throughout life. However, behavioral studies demonstrate that poor people with high self-esteem are often exempt from the deleterious effect of poverty and instead possess a happy and successful life. Here we investigated whether high self-esteem can buffer against the deleterious effects of poverty, as indicated by low subjective socioeconomic status (SSS), on the hippocampal gray matter volume (GMV) in a large cohort of young participants (N = 280). As expected, findings revealed that although low (vs. high) SSS was linked with a smaller hippocampal GMV, the deleterious effect of low SSS on hippocampal GMV was alleviated when the participants have high self-esteem. Commonality analyses further confirmed this observation. The current study suggests that positive psychological resources such as self-esteem may provide protection for the hippocampal atrophy in adversity.

10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00937,Pathway of the Association Between Child Poverty and Low Self-Esteem: Results From a Population-Based Study of Adolescents in Japan,,"Child poverty leads to various negative consequences, including low self-esteem, which is a risk factor for mental illness, suicide, or poor academic achievement. However, little is known about why child poverty leads to low self-esteem. We aimed to elucidate the association of child poverty and low self-esteem based on the ecological model, which includes family-level, school-level, and community-level factors. Data were obtained from the Adachi Child Health Impact of Living Difficulty (A-CHILD) study in 2016, and participants included 1,652 children in fourth grade (534 pairs), sixth grade (530 pairs), and eighth grade (588 pairs) living in Adachi City, Tokyo. A questionnaire survey was implemented to assess child poverty, parental mental health, parental involvement with children, parental social capital by caregivers, and self-esteem and school social capital by children. The structural equation model was applied to elucidate the association between child poverty and low self-esteem, using family-level (parental mental health and parental involvement with children), school-level (school social capital), and community-level (parental social capital) factors. Child poverty was associated with low self-esteem. Child poverty leads to poor parental involvement, which can be indirectly associated with poor parental mental health and poor parental social capital, and poor parental involvement was directly or indirectly associated with low self-esteem through poor school social capital. To mitigate the impact of child poverty on low self-esteem, comprehensive health policies targeting family-level (parental mental health and parental involvement with children), school-level (school social capital), and community-level (parental social capital) factors may be effective.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self esteem,38

10.1007/s12310-021-09410-4,School Dropout Intention and Self-esteem in Immigrant and Native Students Living in Poverty: The Protective Role of Peer Acceptance at School,,"Abstract The psychological well-being at school of immigrant students living in poverty is currently an understudied topic in developmental psychology. This is an important shortcoming because this population, which is rapidly increasing in many western countries, is in a double minority condition and has a greater risk of experiencing psychological distress at school, in comparison with their native peers. In order to improve our understanding on this issue, the present two-wave study investigated the prospective relationships between peer acceptance and two aspects of well-being at school—intention to drop out of school and negative self-esteem—specifically focusing on the differential effect of having (vs. not having) an immigrant background. The participants were 249 preadolescents and adolescents living in poverty ( M age = 12.76; SD age = 2.34; 41.8% girls; 19.3% immigrants) who were attending educational centres for disadvantaged minors. The poverty status of the participants was an inclusion criterion. A multilinear regression model with multigroup analysis was tested. As expected, the results showed that peer acceptance had a significant negative association with school dropout intentions and negative self-esteem only for immigrants, but not for natives. For immigrant students, the protective effect of peer acceptance was comparable to the stability over time of dropout intention and self-esteem, a result that has promising implications for prevention programs. The applied implications of the study for educational and clinical contexts are discussed.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self esteem,34
10.2147/prbm.s349907,Perceived Poverty and Life Satisfaction in College Students with Impoverished Backgrounds: The Mediating Role of Self-Esteem,,"Background: Perceived poverty is a common psychological feeling among college students with impoverished backgrounds. Perceived poverty can harm impoverished college students' interpersonal interactions, psychological health and life satisfaction. This study explored the effect of perceived poverty on the life satisfaction of impoverished college students and the mediating role of self-esteem. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 1044 impoverished college students from 22 universities completed an online questionnaire that included a measure of perceived poverty, self-esteem scale (SES) and satisfaction with life scale (SWLS). Mplus statistical software was used to test whether self-esteem mediates the relationship between perceived poverty and life satisfaction. Results: Perceived poverty and life satisfaction were significantly negatively correlated, self-esteem was significantly positively correlated with life satisfaction, and perceived poverty was significantly negatively correlated with self-esteem. The structural equation model revealed that self-esteem partially mediated the relationship between perceived poverty and life satisfaction. Conclusion: Financial aid programmes should safeguard and strengthen impoverished students' self-esteem while also taking steps to lessen their perceived poverty.

This study focuses on children in poverty, adding a home domain dimension absent in most self-esteem scales and examining gender differences. The study findings show that a process of discounting exists between home and school domains and self-worth gender comparisons show a significant deficit for girls. These results contradict previous research that place the onset of deterioration of girls' self-esteem at an older age.

10.1371/journal.pone.0243457,Assessing mental health in a context of extreme poverty: Validation of the rosenberg self-esteem scale in rural Haiti,,"A widening evidence base across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) points towards mutually reinforcing linkages between poverty and mental health problems. The use of validated and culturally relevant measures of mental health outcomes is crucial to the expansion of evidence. At present, there is a paucity of measures that have been tested and validated in contexts of extreme poverty. Using data from adult women living in extreme poverty in rural Haiti this study assesses the cross-cultural validity of the widely used Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and its applicability in assessing linkages between poverty and mental health outcomes. We find no evidence for a one-dimensional 10-factor structure of the RSES within our data and agree with other authors that the standard self-esteem model does not fit well in this cultural context. Comparisons with another widely used measure of mental health-the K6 measure-indicate that the RSES cannot be used as a proxy for mental health outcomes. We conclude that the use of the RSES in different cultural contexts and with samples with different socioeconomic characteristics should be undertaken with caution; and that greater consideration of the validity of psychosocial constructs and their measurement is vital for gaining robust and replicable insights into breaking the cycle between poverty and mental health problems.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self esteem,8

Parental involvement may be an important determinant to promote self-esteem among adolescents living in poverty. The aim of this study is to explore better parenting involvement behavior to promote self-esteem among adolescents living in poverty. Participants included fifth-, eighth-, and 11th-grade students living in Koichi prefecture, Japan. The participants were part of the Kochi Child Health Impact of Living Difficulty (K-CHILD) study, in 2016 (n = 10,784). Participants completed a questionnaire with questions about socioeconomic status and 14 parental involvement behaviors, including 9 specific kinds of parental interactions with their child (e.g., talking about school life), and 5 elements related to parental care for their child’s physical health (e.g., access to health care). The numbers of parental involvement behaviors, parental interactions with their child, and parental care for their child’s physical health were treated as continuous and quartile, to see the association. Overall, the study showed that the larger the number of parental involvement behaviors, the higher the self-esteem score of their off-spring (p &lt; 0.01) among both adolescents living in poverty and not living in poverty, in which interaction between poverty and parental involvement behaviors was not significant. Both parental interaction with their child and parental care for their child’s physical health were associated with higher self-esteem, in which parental interaction with their child had a larger effect than parental care for their child’s physical health. To empower adolescents in poverty, caregivers need to provide both parental interaction with the child and parental care for the child’s physical health.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self esteem,7

Measures of aggression and self-esteem also were included. Children from abusive homes evidenced significantly more depressive symptomatology than children from either neglectful or nonmaltreating families. Additionally, children from physically abusive homes exhibited lower self-esteem than did nonmaltreated children. While significant differences among groups on aggression did not emerge, all groups evidenced higher levels of acting out behaviors than would be expected in a nonclinic group of children. Results were discussed in terms of the effects of physical abuse on depression and the importance of intervening to prevent the deleterious effects of abuse. Additionally, the impact of neglect and poverty status on the presence of aggression was discussed.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self esteem,240
10.1002/smi.2526,Disadvantaged Family Background and Depression among Young Adults in the United States: The Roles of Chronic Stress and Self‐Esteem,,"Abstract Although several longitudinal studies have demonstrated that having a disadvantaged family background is a risk factor for subsequent symptoms of depression, few studies have examined the mediating mechanisms that explain this long‐term relationship. Thus, this study uses US national longitudinal data and integrates social stress theory with the life course perspective by focusing on two mediating mechanisms—the chronic stress of poverty and self‐esteem during the transition to adulthood. Results reveal that self‐esteem largely mediates the inverse relationship between parental education and levels of depressive symptoms in young adulthood. However, the inverse relationship between parental occupational prestige and depressive symptoms among young adults is not mediated by self‐esteem, but rather long durations of poverty across 16 years. Overall, these findings suggest that different components of family socioeconomic status can leave a lasting imprint on mental health via the self‐concept and the chronic stress of poverty throughout the journey to adulthood.

10.2307/2953351,Can Statutory Rape Laws be Effective in Preventing Adolescent Pregnancy?,,"The male sex partners of minor adolescent women are often 3-6 years older. As policymakers and the general public have become increasingly aware of this reality, there have been calls to enforce states' generally ignored statutory rape laws against sexual intercourse between adults and minors. Statutory rape laws became part of the American legal system through English common law, with early lawmakers in the US setting 10 years of age as the legal age of consent to engage in sexual relations. States gradually increased the age of consent during the 19th century so that the age of consent is now 14-18 years depending upon the state. There is also a widespread perception that adolescent mothers account for the large increase in welfare caseloads over the past 25 years. Policymakers are therefore especially interested in the possibility of reducing adolescent pregnancy rates and welfare costs through the enforcement of statutory rape laws. However, most experts argue that the greater enforcement of such laws will fail to significantly reduce adolescent pregnancy and birth rates. Adolescent childbearing is instead the result of a complex web of factors, including limited opportunity, entrenched poverty, low self-esteem, and many other issues which statutory rape laws do not address.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self esteem,64

Information from a national data set was obtained on a subset of 721 children aged 8-15 and their mothers. Results showed that several risk factors (e.g., poverty status, urban residence, mother's self-esteem) were modestly related to children's academic and behavioral adjustment. Exposure to increasing numbers of risk factors was associated with greater vulnerability to adjustment problems. Several protective factors (e.g., intelligence, self-esteem, quality of the home environment) were also modestly related to children 's adjustment and enhanced the prediction of adjustment above and beyond the contribution of the risk factors. For children exposed to risk, the presence of the protective factors reduced their vulnerability to academic and behavioral difficulties.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self esteem,163

We considered three sets of variables in the latter analysis-mother's early characteristics and behaviors; correlated sociodemographic characteristics; and mediators (neighborhood problems, mother's psychological resources, and characteristics of the home environment) -and evaluated their relevance across three racial/ethnic subgroups (blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites). Consistent with our expectations, we observed a significantly stronger effect of the persistence of poverty on child problems for whites than for blacks, an effect that is attributable to the relatively strong association between poverty and mother's prior history of delinquency and current marital status among whites. The effect of poverty on child problems was substantially explainedfor blacks by mother 's early self-esteem, whereas mediating processes took on greater relevance for Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites. Our results support the conclusion that there are racial/ethnic differences in the selection processes and proximal conditions that are responsible for the diminished psychological well-being ofpoor children.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and self esteem,170

Our results were consistent with the double jeopardy hypothesis for the interaction of race/ethnicity and poverty, but not for the other interactions we estimated. In the case of gender and poverty, the strength of the evidence for the double jeopardy hypothesis varied by outcome: evidence was more consistent for scholastic competence and self-esteem than for depression and hyperactivity.

The focus of the analysis is the adoption of the pan‐ethnic label, 'Hispanic', in contrast to national designators and non‐hyphenated American identities. Using data from a recent large survey of children of immigrants in south Florida and southern California, the analysis explores the determinants of ethnic self‐identities and the potential consequences of the adoption of one of these symbolic labels on children's self‐esteem, educational expectations and perceptions of discrimination. Contrary to the commonly‐held assumption that the label 'Hispanic' denotes greater assimilation into the mainstream of US society, our findings indicate that children who adopt the Hispanic label are the least well assimilated: they report poorer English skills, lower self‐esteem and higher rates of poverty than their counterparts who identify themselves as Americans or as hyphenated Americans.

10.1037/pspp0000143,The family environment in early childhood has a long-term effect on self-esteem: A longitudinal study from birth to age 27 years.,,"A better understanding is needed of the factors that shape the development of individual differences in self-esteem. Using a prospective longitudinal design, this research tested whether the family environment in early childhood predicts self-esteem in later developmental periods. Data came from a nationally representative U.S. sample of 8,711 participants, who reported on their self-esteem biannually from age 8 to 27 years. Moreover, during the participants' first 6 years of life, biannual assessments of their mothers provided information on the quality of the home environment (covering quality of parenting, cognitive stimulation, and physical home environment), quality of parental relationship, presence of father, maternal depression, and poverty status of the family. The analyses were conducted using nonlinear regression analyses of age-dependent correlation coefficients, which were controlled for the effects of child gender and ethnicity. The results suggested that the family environment in early childhood significantly predicted self-esteem as the children grew up. Although the effects became smaller with age, the effects were still present during young adulthood. The largest effects emerged for quality of home environment. Moreover, the results suggested that the effects of home environment, presence of father, and poverty are enduring, as indicated by a nonzero asymptote in the time course of effects from age 8 to 27 years. Finally, quality of home environment partially accounted for the effects of the other predictors. The findings suggest that the home environment is a key factor in early childhood that influences the long-term development of self-esteem.

This study set out to examine differences in the explanations for unemployment as a function of whether people were employed or unemployed, as well as their age, sex, education and voting pattern, The results showed a predictable pattern of differences between the employed and unemployed, the former believing more in individualistic explanations and less in societal explanations than the latter. Whereas there were few sex and age differences, education and vote revealed numerous differences in explanations for unemployment. As in the case with explanations for poverty, Conservatives found individualistic explanations for unemployment more important than Labour voters who in turn found societal explanations more important than Conservative voters.

10.1126/science.1238041,Poverty Impedes Cognitive Function,,"The poor often behave in less capable ways, which can further perpetuate poverty. We hypothesize that poverty directly impedes cognitive function and present two studies that test this hypothesis. First, we experimentally induced thoughts about finances and found that this reduces cognitive performance among poor but not in well-off participants. Second, we examined the cognitive function of farmers over the planting cycle. We found that the same farmer shows diminished cognitive performance before harvest, when poor, as compared with after harvest, when rich. This cannot be explained by differences in time available, nutrition, or work effort. Nor can it be explained with stress: Although farmers do show more stress before harvest, that does not account for diminished cognitive performance. Instead, it appears that poverty itself reduces cognitive capacity. We suggest that this is because poverty-related concerns consume mental resources, leaving less for other tasks. These data provide a previously unexamined perspective and help explain a spectrum of behaviors among the poor.

Students' beliefs in their efficacy to regulate their own learning and to master academic activities determine their aspirations, level of motivation, and academic accomplishments. Teachers' beliefs in their personal efficacy to motivate and promote learning affect the types of learning environments they create and the level of academic progress their students achieve. Faculties' beliefs in their collective instructional efficacy contribute significantly to their schools' level of academic achievement. Student body characteristics influence school-level achievement more strongly by altering faculties' beliefs in their collective efficacy than through direct affects on school achievement.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Cognitive function,7224
10.2307/1130201,Development of Cortical Circuitry and Cognitive Function,,"Recent functional and anatomical studies in nonhuman primates have elucidated the basic neural circuitry underlying delayed-response function in adult nonhuman primates. Thus circuitry includes connections of the principal sulcus with other areas of parietal association and limbic cortex and projections to the caudate nucleus, superior colliculus, and other premotor centers. Anatomical tracing in primate fetuses and in monkeys at various stages of postnatal development indicates that these various classes of cortical connections begin to form by the second trimester of pregnancy. Electromicroscopic studies of the principal sulcus and other areas of cerebral cortex show that the number and density of synapses in the cortex increase rapidly, reaching and maintaining higher than normal adult values between 2 and 4 months postnatally, before slowly declining over a period of years to stable adult levels. The capacity to perform delayed-response and/or AB at short delays emerges around 4 months of age, coinciding with the end of the period of highest synaptic density in the principal sulcus. These findings suggest that a critical mass of cortical synapses is important for the emergence of this cognitive function, and that fully mature capacity may depend upon the elimination of excess synapses that occurs during adolescence and young adulthood. Knowledge of the neural basis of normal cognitive development may prove useful both to social and educational purposes as well as to understanding developmental disorders of cognition.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Cognitive function,794

Midlife systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values were measured in 1965,1968, and 1971. A respondent was classified into the following categories if two of three measurements fell into the following groups: for SBP, &lt;110, 110 to 139, 140 to 159, and ≥160 mm Hg; and for DBP, &lt;80, 80 to 89, 90 to 94, and ≥95 mm Hg. <h3>Results.</h3> —When we controlled for age and education, the risk for intermediate and poor cognitive function increased progressively with increasing level of midlife SBP category (<i>P</i>for trend &lt;.03 and &lt;.001, respectively). For every 10—mm Hg increase in SBP there was an increase in risk for intermediate cognitive function of 7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3% to 11%) and for poor cognitive function of 9% (95% CI, 3% to 16%). Adjustment for prevalent stroke, coronary heart disease, and subclinical atherosclerosis reduced the strength of the relationship between midlife SBP and poor cognitive function to 5% (95% CI, 0% to 12%). The level of cognitive function was not associated with midlife DBP. <h3>Conclusions.</h3> —Midlife SBP is a significant predictor of reduced cognitive function in later life.

Of 4894 eligible postmenopausal women aged 65 years or older and free of probable dementia at baseline, 4532 (92.6%) were enrolled in the estrogen plus progestin component of WHIMS. A total of 4381 participants (96.7%) provided at least 1 valid cognitive function score between June 1995 and July 8, 2002.Participants received either 1 daily tablet containing 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen with 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 2145) or matching placebo (n = 2236).Global cognitive function measured annually with the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination.The Modified Mini-Mental State Examination mean total scores in both groups increased slightly over time (mean follow-up of 4.2 years). Women in the estrogen plus progestin group had smaller average increases in total scores compared with women receiving placebo (P =.03), but these differences were not clinically important.

METHOD: Several domains of cognitive function were examined in 30 depressed bipolar patients (DSM-IV criteria for major depression, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score ≥17), 34 manic or hypomanic bipolar patients (DSM-IV criteria for manic or hypomanic episode, Young Mania Rating Scale score ≥12), and 44 euthymic bipolar patients (6 months of remission, Hamilton depression scale score ≤8, and Young Mania Rating Scale score ≤6). The comparison group consisted of 30 healthy subjects without history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. A neuropsychological battery assessed executive function, attention, and verbal and visual memory. RESULTS: The three groups showed cognitive dysfunction in verbal memory and frontal executive tasks in relation to the comparison group. Low neuropsychological performance was associated with poor functional outcome. Impairment of verbal memory was related to the duration of illness and the numbers of previous manic episodes, hospitalizations, and suicide attempts. CONCLUSIONS: A poorer performance was observed in all bipolar groups regarding executive function and verbal memory in relation to the healthy comparison subjects. These cognitive difficulties, especially related to verbal memory, may help explain the impairment regarding daily functioning, even during remission. Further studies should focus on testing, whether optimizing prophylactic pharmacological treatment and psychoeducation might reduce cognitive impairment, and whether bipolar patients would benefit from neuropsychological rehabilitation in order to reduce the impact of cognitive impairment in their overall functioning.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Cognitive function,1076

A total of 599 participants were followed up from age 85 years through age 89 years (mean [SD] follow-up, 3.7 [1.4] years).Main Outcome MeasuresComplete thyroid status at baseline; disability in daily life, depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and mortality from age 85 years through 89 years.ResultsPlasma levels of thyrotropin and free thyroxine were not associated with disability in daily life, depressive symptoms, and cognitive impairment at baseline or during follow-up. Increasing levels of thyrotropin were associated with a lower mortality rate that remained after adjustments were made for baseline disability and health status. The hazard ratio (HR) for mortality per SD increase of 2.71 mIU/L of thyrotropin was 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-0.94; P = .009).

It is uncertain whether this disruption is due to a specific relation of cholinergic neurons to M/C functions, or whether the effect is nonspecific, resulting either from alteration of alertness and attention, or from a ""mass action"" effect, with loss of functioning neurons. Scopolamine was given to normal subjects to produce an M/C impairment. Half the test subjects then received physostigmine and half d-amphetamine. Physostigmine, a pharmacologic antagonist of scopolamine, markedly improved M/C functions; amphetamine failed to produce M/C improvement, although alertness was improved, and activity in catecholaminergic neurons presumably increased.

We used diffusion tensor MR imaging and calculated fractional anisotropy, an indicator of myelination and axonal thickness, in children aged between 8 and 18 years. Development of working memory capacity was positively correlated with fractional anisotropy in two regions in the left frontal lobe, including a region between the superior frontal and parietal cortices. Reading ability, on the other hand, was only correlated with fractional anisotropy in the left temporal lobe, in the same white matter region where adults with reading disability are known to have lower fractional anisotropy. Both the temporal and the frontal regions were also correlated with age. These results show that maturation of white matter is an important part of brain maturation during childhood, and that maturation of relatively restricted regions of white matter is correlated with development of specific cognitive functions.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Cognitive function,784
10.1017/s0140525x00078407,The role of attention in auditory information processing as revealed by event-related potentials and other brain measures of cognitive function,,"Abstract This article examines the role of attention and automaticity in auditory processing as revealed by event-related potential (ERP) research. An ERP component called the mismatch negativity , generated by the brain's automatic response to changes in repetitive auditory input, reveals that physical features of auditory stimuli are fully processed whether or not they are attended. It also suggests that there exist precise neuronal representations of the physical features of recent auditory stimuli, perhaps the traces underlying acoustic sensory (“echoic”) memory. A mechanism of passive attention switching in response to changes in repetitive input is also implicated. Conscious perception of discrete acoustic stimuli might be mediated by some of the mechanisms underlying another ERP component (NI), one sensitive to stimulus onset and offset. Frequent passive attentional shifts might accountforthe effect cognitive psychologists describe as “the breakthrough of the unattended” (Broadbent 1982), that is, that even unattended stimuli may be semantically processed, without assuming automatic semantic processing or late selection in selective attention. The processing negativity supports the early-selection theory and may arise from a mechanism for selectively attending to stimuli defined by certain features. This stimulus selection occurs in the form ofa matching process in which each input is compared with the “attentional trace,” a voluntarily maintained representation of the task-relevant features of the stimulus to be attended. The attentional mechanism described might underlie the stimulus-set mode of attention proposed by Broadbent. Finally, a model of automatic and attentional processing in audition is proposed that is based mainly on the aforementioned ERP components and some other physiological measures.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Cognitive function,1657

The purpose of this study was to examine the validity of the Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in MS (MACFIMS), a recommended battery based on the findings of an international conference held in 2001. We tested 291 MS patients and 56 healthy controls. Frequencies of impairment paralleled those reported in previous work for both individual cognitive domains and general impairment. All tests were impaired in the MS group, and distinguished relapsing-remitting (RR) from secondary progressive (SP) course. Principle components analysis showed a distinct episodic memory component. Most of the MACFIMS tests discriminated disabled from employed patients. However, in regression models accounting for all NP tests, those emphasizing verbal memory and executive function were most predictive of vocational status.

Methods:The effects of loud (105-dB) noise stress were examined on a spatial working memory task (delayed response) dependent on the PFC, and on a reference memory task with similar motor and motivational demands (visual pattern discrimination) dependent on the inferior temporal cortex.The role of dopamine mechanisms was tested by challenging the stress response with agents that decrease dopamine receptor stimulation.Results: Exposure to noise stress significantly impaired delayed-response performance.Stress did not im-pair performance on ""0-second"" delay control trials and did not alter visual pattern discrimination performance, which is consistent with impaired PFC cognitive function rather than nonspecific changes in performance.Stress-induced deficits in delayed-response performance were ameliorated by pretreatment with drugs that block dopamine receptors (haloperidol, SCH 23390) or reduce stress-induced PFC dopamine turnover in rodents (clonidine, naloxone hydrochloride).Conclusions: These results indicate that stress impairs PFC cognitive function through a hyperdopaminergic mechanism.Stress may take the PFC ""off-line"" to allow more habitual responses mediated by posterior cortical and subcortical structures to regulate behavior.This mechanism may have survival value, but may often be maladaptive in human society, contributing to the vulnerability of the PFC in many neuropsychiatric disorders.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Cognitive function,585

Additionally, the relationship between changes in BDNF and cognitive function was examined.Fifteen subjects (25.4 +/- 1.01 yr; 11 male, 4 female) performed a graded exercise test (GXT) for the determination of VO2max and ventilatory threshold (VTh) on a cycle ergometer. On separate days, two subsequent 30-min endurance rides were performed at 20% below the VTh (VTh - 20) and at 10% above the VTh (VTh + 10). Serum BDNF and cognitive function were determined before and after the GXT and endurance rides with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the Stroop tests, respectively.The mean VO2max was 2805.8 +/- 164.3 mL x min(-1) (104.2 +/- 7.0% pred). BDNF values (pg x mL(-1)) increased from baseline (P<0.05) after exercise at the VTh + 10 (13%) and the GXT (30%). There was no significant change in BDNF from baseline after the VTh - 20. Changes in BDNF did not correlate with VO2max during the GXT, but they did correlate with changes in lactate (r=0.57; P<0.05). Cognitive function scores improved after all exercise conditions, but they did not correlate with BDNF changes.BDNF levels in humans are significantly elevated in response to exercise, and the magnitude of increase is exercise intensity dependent.

Approximately 58 years later, the women who wrote these autobiographies participated in an assessment of cognitive function, and those who subsequently died were evaluated neuropathologically. <h3>Setting.</h3> —Convents in the United States participating in the Nun Study; primarily convents in the Milwaukee, Wis, area. <h3>Participants.</h3> —Cognitive function was investigated in 93 participants who were aged 75 to 95 years at the time of their assessments, and Alzheimer's disease was investigated in the 14 participants who died at 79 to 96 years of age. <h3>Main Outcome Measures.</h3> —Seven neuropsychological tests and neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease. <h3>Results.</h3> —Low idea density and low grammatical complexity in autobiographies written in early life were associated with low cognitive test scores in late life. Low idea density in early life had stronger and more consistent associations with poor cognitive function than did low grammatical complexity. Among the 14 sisters who died, neuropathologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease was present in all of those with low idea density in early life and in none of those with high idea density. <h3>Conclusions.</h3> —Low linguistic ability in early life was a strong predictor of poor cognitive function and Alzheimer's disease in late life.

10.1200/jco.2000.18.14.2695,Cognitive Function in Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Adjuvant Chemotherapy,,"PURPOSE: Breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy have complained of difficulties in their ability to remember, think, and concentrate. This study assessed whether there are differences in cognitive function between breast cancer patients treated with standard-dose adjuvant chemotherapy compared with healthy controls. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The High Sensitivity Cognitive Screen and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) were used to assess cognitive function and mood in a group of 107 women. The women consisted of 31 breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (group A), 40 breast cancer patients who had completed adjuvant chemotherapy a median of 2 years earlier (group B), and 36 healthy controls (group C). RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed statistically significant differences (P = .009) in overall cognitive function scores between groups A and C, with poorer function in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. These differences remained significant (P = .046) when controlling for age, education level, and menopausal status. More patients had moderate or severe cognitive impairment in groups A and B than in controls (P ≤ .002). There were no significant differences in POMS scores between the groups, suggesting that the differences seen in cognitive scores were unlikely to be because of mood disturbance. CONCLUSION: Cognitive differences were observed in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy compared with healthy controls. These differences did not seem to be caused by significant differences in mood disturbance between the two groups. If confirmed, these results have substantial implications for informed consent, counseling, and psychosocial support of patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Cognitive function,565
10.1093/brain/111.2.299,‘FRONTAL’ COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE ‘ON’AND ‘OFF’ LEVODOPA,,"A wide range of cognitive impairments can be observed in patients with Parkinson's disease. A close parallel exists between these deficits and those found following damage to prefrontal cortex. Anatomical evidence is reviewed which reveals a complex pattern of neuronal circuits connecting the frontal cortex and basal ganglia. All these circuits are in some way dependent upon dopamine, suggesting that changes in the levels of dopamine stimulation may alter performance on 'frontal' tests. To test this hypothesis, a group of patients with Parkinson's disease were assessed both on and off levodopa treatment, on a range of tests selected from the human and animal experimental literature as being sensitive to disruption of prefrontal cortex. A variable pattern of results was obtained. On one test, a measure of verbal fluency, patients were impaired, compared with normal controls, only when off levodopa. On two measures, associative conditional learning and subject- ordered pointing, patients were impaired only when on levodopa, while on the final measures, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, patients were impaired both on and off levodopa. Two mechanisms are discussed to explain these results, one based on the effects of dopamine depletion, and the other based on the adverse effects of dopamine overstimulation. The results suggest that different areas of prefrontal cortex are involved in the tasks employed, and that functional levels of dopamine in separate areas of cortex and caudate may differ crucially in Parkinson's disease.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Cognitive function,846

Cognitive impairment in the acute phase of illness has been frequently reported. The findings are shown in different cognitive domains, such as executive functions, attention, memory and psychomotor speed. Fewer reports have investigated cognitive functioning in MDD in longitudinal studies. Some longitudinal reports show that the impairment observed in the acute phase of illness may be long lasting despite symptom reduction and recovery. However, findings regarding cognitive functioning in depression are divergent. Factors that might contribute to the divergent findings, such as depression subtype, severity and comorbidity are discussed. Clinical implications and focus of future research directions is highlighted.In conclusion, depression is associated with cognitive impairment in the acute phase of illness, and some reports indicate that this impairment might be long lasting despite symptom reduction and recovery.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Cognitive function,460

DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Community‐based study of noninstitutionalized adults aged 55 and older living in Sonoma, California. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred forty‐nine cohort members without evidence of cardiovascular disease, musculoskeletal disability, or cognitive impairment at baseline. MEASUREMENTS: Cardiorespiratory fitness measures were based on a standard treadmill exercise test protocol and included peak oxygen consumption (peak VO 2 ), treadmill exercise duration, and oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES). Cognitive function was evaluated at baseline with a modified Mini‐Mental State Examination (mMMSE) and after 6 years of follow‐up with a detailed cognitive test battery that included the full MMSE, three tests of attention/executive function, two measures of verbal memory, and two tests of verbal fluency. RESULTS: Participants with worse cardiorespiratory fitness at baseline experienced greater decline on the mMMSE over 6 years (mean mMMSE decline (95% confidence interval) by baseline peak VO 2 tertile: lowest = −0.5 (−0.8 to −0.3), middle = −0.2 (−0.5–0.0), highest = 0.0 (−0.3–0.2), P = .002 for trend over tertiles). Participants with worse baseline cardiorespiratory fitness also performed worse on all cognitive tests conducted 6 years later. Results were similar for analyses based on peak VO 2 , treadmill exercise duration, and OUES. After adjustment for demographic and health‐related covariates, measures of cardiorespiratory fitness were associated most strongly with measures of global cognitive function and attention/executive function. CONCLUSION: Baseline measures of cardiorespiratory fitness are positively associated with preservation of cognitive function over a 6‐year period and with levels of performance on cognitive tests conducted 6 years later in healthy older adults. High cardiorespiratory fitness may protect against cognitive dysfunction in older people.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Cognitive function,599

Secondary end points included time to intracranial failure, quality of life, functional independence, long-term cognitive status, and overall survival. <h3>Results</h3> There were 213 randomized participants (SRS alone, n = 111; SRS plus WBRT, n = 102) with a mean age of 60.6 years (SD, 10.5 years); 103 (48%) were women. There was less cognitive deterioration at 3 months after SRS alone (40/63 patients [63.5%]) than when combined with WBRT (44/48 patients [91.7%]; difference, −28.2%; 90% CI, −41.9% to −14.4%;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Quality of life was higher at 3 months with SRS alone, including overall quality of life (mean change from baseline, −1.3 vs −10.9 points; mean difference, 9.6; 95% CI, 3.6-15.6 points;<i>P</i> = .002). Time to intracranial failure was significantly shorter for SRS alone compared with SRS plus WBRT (hazard ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 2.2-5.9;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). There was no significant difference in functional independence at 3 months between the treatment groups (mean change from baseline, −1.5 points for SRS alone vs −4.2 points for SRS plus WBRT; mean difference, 2.7 points; 95% CI, −2.0 to 7.4 points;<i>P</i> = .26). Median overall survival was 10.4 months for SRS alone and 7.4 months for SRS plus WBRT (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.75-1.38;<i>P</i> = .92). For long-term survivors, the incidence of cognitive deterioration was less after SRS alone at 3 months (5/11 [45.5%] vs 16/17 [94.1%]; difference, −48.7%; 95% CI, −87.6% to −9.7%;<i>P</i> = .007) and at 12 months (6/10 [60%] vs 17/18 [94.4%]; difference, −34.4%; 95% CI, −74.4% to 5.5%;<i>P</i> = .04). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Among patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases, the use of SRS alone, compared with SRS combined with WBRT, resulted in less cognitive deterioration at 3 months. In the absence of a difference in overall survival, these findings suggest that for patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases amenable to radiosurgery, SRS alone may be a preferred strategy. <h3>Trial Registration</h3> clinicaltrials.gov Identifier:NCT00377156",Openalex,Psychology-related,Cognitive function,1402

Women were assigned to a screening group (in which measurements were obtained immediately) or a control group (in which serum was stored and measurements were obtained shortly after delivery). Thyrotropin levels above the 97.5th percentile, free T(4) levels below the 2.5th percentile, or both were considered a positive screening result. Women with positive findings in the screening group were assigned to 150 μg of levothyroxine per day. The primary outcome was IQ at 3 years of age in children of women with positive results, as measured by psychologists who were unaware of the group assignments.Of 21,846 women who provided blood samples (at a median gestational age of 12 weeks 3 days), 390 women in the screening group and 404 in the control group tested positive. The median gestational age at the start of levothyroxine treatment was 13 weeks 3 days; treatment was adjusted as needed to achieve a target thyrotropin level of 0.1 to 1.0 mIU per liter. Among the children of women with positive results, the mean IQ scores were 99.2 and 100.0 in the screening and control groups, respectively (difference, 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1.1 to 2.6; P=0.40 by intention-to-treat analysis); the proportions of children with an IQ of less than 85 were 12.1% in the screening group and 14.1% in the control group (difference, 2.1 percentage points; 95% CI, -2.6 to 6.7; P=0.39).

Subsets of these studies have been reviewed using the traditional narrative method, and the common conclusion has been that the results are mixed. Therefore, a more comprehensive review is needed that includes all available studies and that provides a more objective and reproducible review process. Thus, a meta-analytic review was conducted that included all relevant studies with sufficient information for the calculation of effect size ( N = 134). The overall effect size was 0.25, suggesting that exercise has a small positive effect on cognition. Examination of the moderator variables indicated that characteristics related to the exercise paradigm, the participants, the cognitive tests, and the quality of the study influence effect size. However, the most important finding was that as experimental rigor decreased, effect size increased. Therefore, more studies need to be conducted that emphasize experimental rigor.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Cognitive function,751

10.1017/s0954579401003133,Can poverty get under your skin? Basal cortisol levels and cognitive function in children from low and high socioeconomic status,,"It is well known that individuals from more advantaged social classes enjoy better mental and physical health than do individuals within lower classes. Various mechanisms have been evoked to explain the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and health. One mechanism that has received particular attention in recent years is stress. It has been shown that individuals lower in SES report greater exposure to stressful life events and a greater impact of these events on their life than individuals higher in SES. In order to measure whether the development of the relationship between SES and mental health is sustained by exposure to high levels of glucocorticoids, we measured morning salivary cortisol levels as well as cognitive function (memory, attention, and language) in 307 children (from 6 to 16 years of age) from low versus high SES in the Montreal area in Canada. The results revealed that low SES children from 6 to 10 years old present significantly higher salivary cortisol levels when compared to children from high SES. This difference disappears at the time of school transition, and no SES differences are observed in salivary cortisol levels during high school. However, children from low and high SES do not differ with regard to memory or to attentional and linguistic functions. Also, mothers of low SES children reported higher feelings of depression and more unhealthy behaviors, while mothers of high SES children reported higher stress related to work or family transitions. Altogether, these results show that low SES in young children is related to increased cortisol secretion, although the impact of SES on cortisol secretion is absent after transition to high school. These data are interpreted within the context of the equalization process of class patterning. Four social explanatory factors are suggested to explain the disappearance of SES differences in basal cortisol levels after school transition, taking into account the influence of family environment on the child's secretion of stress hormones.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive Function,586

There is increasing evidence that neighborhood context explains unique variance not accounted for by household SES. <h3>Objective</h3> To evaluate whether neighborhood poverty (NP) is associated with cognitive function and prefrontal and hippocampal brain structure in ways that are dissociable from household SES. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This cross-sectional study used a baseline sample of the ongoing longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. The ABCD Study will follow participants for assessments each year for 10 years. Data were collected at 21 US sites, mostly within urban and suburban areas, between September 2019 and October 2018. School-based recruitment was used to create a participant sample reflecting the US population. Data analysis was conducted from March to June 2019. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> NP and household SES were included as factors potentially associated with National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognitive Battery subtests and hippocampal and prefrontal (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC], dorsomedial PFC [DMPFC], superior frontal gyrus [SFG]) volumes. Independent variables were first considered individually and then together in mixed-effects models with age, sex, and intracranial volume as covariates. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to assess shared variance in NP to brain structure and cognitive task associations. The tested hypotheses were formulated after data collection. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 11 875 children aged 9 and 10 years (5678 [47.8%] girls) were analyzed. Greater NP was associated with lower scores across all cognitive domains (eg, total composite: β = −0.18; 95% CI, −0.21 to −0.15;<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and with decreased brain volume in the DLPFC (eg, right DLPFC: β = −0.09; 95% CI, −0.12 to −0.07;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), DMPFC (eg, right DMPC: β = −0.07; 95% CI, −0.09 to −0.05;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), SFG (eg, right SFG: β = −0.05; 95% CI, −0.08 to −0.03;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), and right hippocampus (β = −0.04; 95% CI, −0.06 to −0.01;<i>P</i> = .01), even when accounting for household income. Greater household income was associated with higher scores across all cognitive domains (eg, total composite: β = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.33;<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and larger volume in all prefrontal and hippocampal brain regions (eg, right hippocampus: β = 0.04; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.07;<i>P</i> &lt; .001) even when accounting for NP. The SEM model was a good fit across all cognitive domains, with prefrontal regions being associated with NP relations to language (picture vocabulary: estimate [SE], –0.03 [0.01];<i>P</i> &lt; .001; oral reading: estimate [SE], –0.02 [0.01];<i>P</i> &lt; .001), episodic memory (picture sequence: estimate [SE], –0.02 [0.01];<i>P</i> = .008), and working memory (dimensional card sort: estimate [SE], –0.02 [0.01];<i>P</i> = .001; flanker inhibitory control: estimate [SE], –0.01 [0.01];<i>P</i> = .01; list sorting: estimate [SE], –0.03 [0.01];<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and hippocampal regions being associated with NP associations with language (picture vocabulary: estimate [SE], –0.01 [0.004];<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and episodic memory (picture sequence: estimate [SE], –0.01 [0.004];<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> In this study, NP accounted for unique variance in cognitive function and prefrontal and right hippocampal brain volume.

Duration of poverty, defined according to urban and rural regional standards from the China Statistical Yearbook, was assessed according to annual household income from 2005 to 2011 (never in poverty; one-third of the period in poverty; two-thirds or more of the period in poverty). Cognitive function was measured by the Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination (CMMSE) from 2011 to 2018. We used attrition-weighted, multivariable mixed-effects Tobit regression to examine the association of duration of poverty with cognitive function and rate of decline.A total of 1,162 individuals (36.21%) were never in poverty over the period from 2005 to 2011; 1,172 (36.52%) were in poverty one-third of the period; and 875 (27.27%) were in poverty two-thirds or more of the period. A longer poverty duration was associated with lower subsequent CMMSE scores with a dose-response relationship (one-third vs never in poverty: β = -0.98; 95% confidence interval -1.61 to -0.35; two-thirds or more vs never in poverty: β = -1.55; 95% confidence interval -2.29 to -0.81). However, a longer duration of poverty was associated with a slower rate of CMMSE score decline over time from 2011 to 2018.These findings provide valuable evidence for the role of cumulative late-life poverty in relation to cognitive health among older adults in a rapidly urbanizing and aging middle-income country.

10.1371/journal.pone.0278618,Associations between early childhood poverty and cognitive functioning throughout childhood and adolescence: A 14-year prospective longitudinal analysis of the Mauritius Child Health Project,,"Associations between childhood poverty and cognitive outcomes have been examined from multiple perspectives. However, most evidence is based on cross-sectional data or longitudinal data covering only segments of the developmental process. Moreover, previous longitudinal research has mostly relied on data from Western nations, limiting insights of poverty dynamics in low- and middle-income countries. Here, we use data from the Mauritius Child Health Project, a large-scale prospective longitudinal study conducted in a then low-income country, to examine long-term associations between poverty in early childhood and cognitive performance across childhood and adolescence. Poverty-related factors were assessed at age 3 years and comprised indicators of psychosocial adversity and malnutrition. Cognitive functioning was assessed at ages 3 and 11 years by using standardized intelligence measures and at age 17 years by means of a computerized test battery. Using multiple hierarchical regression models, we found that chronic malnutrition and parental characteristics showed similar-sized, independent associations with initial cognitive functioning at age 3 as well as at age 11 years. For age 17 years, however, associations with early childhood risk factors vanished and instead, cognitive functioning was predicted by performance on prior cognitive assessments. Sex was also found to be a powerful predictor of cognitive trajectories, with boys improving and girls worsening over time, regardless of the level of their initial exposure to risk. The current findings indicate that, to prevent cognitive impairment, interventions tackling poverty and malnutrition should focus on the infancy period and be designed in a gender-sensitive way.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive Function,4

After adjustment for gender, race/ethnicity, poverty, region of the country, parent or caregiver's educational level, parent or caregiver's marital status parent, serum ferritin level, and serum cotinine level, the data showed an inverse relationship between blood lead concentration and scores on four measures of cognitive functioning. For every 1 microg/dL increase in blood lead concentration, there was a 0.7-point decrement in mean arithmetic scores, an approximately 1-point decrement in mean reading scores, a 0.1-point decrement in mean scores on a measure of nonverbal reasoning, and a 0.5-point decrement in mean scores on a measure of short-term memory. An inverse relationship between blood lead concentration and arithmetic and reading scores was observed for children with blood lead concentrations lower than 5.0 microg/dL.Deficits in cognitive and academic skills associated with lead exposure occur at blood lead concentrations lower than 5 microg/dL.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive Function,885

The arguments presented are: first, that the behavior which leads to social, educational, and economic poverty 'is socialized in early childhood; second, that the central quality involved in the effects of cultural deprivation is a lack of cognitive meaning in the' mother-child communication system; and, third, that the growth of cognitiv'e processes is fostered in family control systems which offer and permit a wide range of alternatives of action and thought and that such growth is constricted by systems of control which offer predetermined solutions and few alternatives for consideration and choice. The research group was composed of 160 Negro mothers and their 4-year-old children selected from four different social status levels. The data are presented to show social status differences among the four groups with respect to cognitive functioning and linguistic codes and to offer examples of relations between maternal and child behavior that are congruent with the general lines of argument laid out.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive Function,624

Using data from the 2000 and 2007 waves of the Indonesian Family Life Survey, we estimated the associations of early-life poverty (at age <7 years) and poverty in later childhood (at age 7-14 years) with cognitive function at age 7-14 years. Our analysis provided little support for the idea that an early intervention to support household income has a larger effect than intervention later in childhood; both seemed equally important. We also decomposed the effect of poverty at age <7 years into direct and indirect effects mediated through poverty and schooling/home environment at age 7-14 years. For decomposing the effects, we used 3 approaches: 1) joint mediators, 2) path-specific, and 3) intervention analog. Being exposed to poverty before age 7 years had a larger direct effect (difference in cognitive function z score) on child cognitive function at age 7-14 years (i.e., joint mediators β = -0.07, 95% confidence interval: -0.12, -0.02) than the indirect effects mediated through later poverty at age 7-14 years (β = -0.01, 95% confidence interval: -0.04, 0.01) and school attendance/home environment at age 7-14 years. The effect of poverty on cognitive function was small; nevertheless, financial intervention may still benefit children's cognitive function.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive Function,7
10.3390/ijerph15010016,Pollution from Fossil-Fuel Combustion is the Leading Environmental Threat to Global Pediatric Health and Equity: Solutions Exist,,"Fossil-fuel combustion by-products are the world’s most significant threat to children’s health and future and are major contributors to global inequality and environmental injustice. The emissions include a myriad of toxic air pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the most important human-produced climate-altering greenhouse gas. Synergies between air pollution and climate change can magnify the harm to children. Impacts include impairment of cognitive and behavioral development, respiratory illness, and other chronic diseases—all of which may be “seeded“ in utero and affect health and functioning immediately and over the life course. By impairing children’s health, ability to learn, and potential to contribute to society, pollution and climate change cause children to become less resilient and the communities they live in to become less equitable. The developing fetus and young child are disproportionately affected by these exposures because of their immature defense mechanisms and rapid development, especially those in low- and middle-income countries where poverty and lack of resources compound the effects. No country is spared, however: even high-income countries, especially low-income communities and communities of color within them, are experiencing impacts of fossil fuel-related pollution, climate change and resultant widening inequality and environmental injustice. Global pediatric health is at a tipping point, with catastrophic consequences in the absence of bold action. Fortunately, technologies and interventions are at hand to reduce and prevent pollution and climate change, with large economic benefits documented or predicted. All cultures and communities share a concern for the health and well-being of present and future children: this shared value provides a politically powerful lever for action. The purpose of this commentary is to briefly review the data on the health impacts of fossil-fuel pollution, highlighting the neurodevelopmental impacts, and to briefly describe available means to achieve a low-carbon economy, and some examples of interventions that have benefited health and the economy.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive Function,966

Aspects of cognitive functioning, such as information processing, may underlie these kinds of problems. How might poverty affect the brain functions underlying these cognitive processes? Here, we address this question by observing and analyzing repeated measures of brain development of young children between five months and four years of age from economically diverse backgrounds (n = 77). In doing so, we have the opportunity to observe changes in brain growth as children begin to experience the effects of poverty. These children underwent MRI scanning, with subjects completing between 1 and 7 scans longitudinally. Two hundred and three MRI scans were divided into different tissue types using a novel image processing algorithm specifically designed to analyze brain data from young infants. Total gray, white, and cerebral (summation of total gray and white matter) volumes were examined along with volumes of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Infants from low-income families had lower volumes of gray matter, tissue critical for processing of information and execution of actions. These differences were found for both the frontal and parietal lobes. No differences were detected in white matter, temporal lobe volumes, or occipital lobe volumes. In addition, differences in brain growth were found to vary with socioeconomic status (SES), with children from lower-income households having slower trajectories of growth during infancy and early childhood. Volumetric differences were associated with the emergence of disruptive behavioral problems.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive Function,410
10.1093/sf/77.1.257,The Timing of the Influences of Cumulative Poverty on Children's Cognitive Ability and Achievement,,"Is childhood such a critical period that, by the end of this period, cumulative poverty would have exerted maximum effect on children's cognitive outcomes? Or are cognitive outcomes more a function of the length of exposure to poverty regardless of the life stage in which the child is exposed to poverty? The NLSY, which measures each child's cognitive development repeatedly over time, was analyzed to answer these questions. We distinguish between ability and achievement. Ability is a more stable trait than achievement and tends to be determined by both environmental and genetic factors early in life. Achievement on the other hand is more acquired. This study shows that long-term poverty has substantial influences on both ability and achievement, but the time patterns of these influences are distinctly different. Childhood appears to be a much more crucial period for the development of cognitive ability than early adolescence. In contrast, poverty experienced in adolescence appears to be more influential to adolescent achievement than poverty experienced earlier in life.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive Function,186

Only 26 children were identified as functioning in the normal range for cognitive, social/adaptive, health, and growth parameters at age 3. These children, who showed early signs of resiliency, differed from nonresilient children in that they were receiving more responsive, accepting, stimulating, and organized care. They were also living in safer, less crowded homes. 6 ""protective"" aspects of caregiving were identified and used as part of a cumulative protection index. Children with less than 3 protective aspects of caregiving present at age 1 had only a 2% probability of being resilient, and only a 6% probability if fewer than 3 were present at age 3. Overall, premature LBW children born into conditions of poverty have a very poor prognosis of functioning within normal ranges across all the dimensions of health and development assessed.

Temporal changes and instability in family processes, but not income, predicted children's adjustment. Cross-sectional mediational analyses indicated that for families living at the poverty threshold, family processes fully mediated the effect of average income over the study period on social behavior but only partially mediated its effect on cognitive-linguistic development. The strength of these associations diminished as average income exceeded the poverty threshold.

In the study reported here, 40 Portuguese-Luxembourgish bilingual children from low-income immigrant families in Luxembourg and 40 matched monolingual children from Portugal completed visuospatial tests of working memory, abstract reasoning, selective attention, and interference suppression. Two broad cognitive factors of executive functioning—representation (abstract reasoning and working memory) and control (selective attention and interference suppression)—emerged from principal component analysis. Whereas there were no group differences in representation, the bilinguals performed significantly better than did the monolinguals in control. These results demonstrate, first, that the bilingual advantage is neither confounded with nor limited by socioeconomic and cultural factors and, second, that separable aspects of executive functioning are differentially affected by bilingualism. The bilingual advantage lies in control but not in visuospatial representational processes.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive Function,267

The differential strength of correlation between symptoms, cognition and other patient characteristics with community functioning in first-episode psychosis has not been fully investigated. Method. In a sample of 66 first-episode psychosis patients demographic variables, ratings of pre-morbid adjustment, positive and negative symptoms, duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) and assessment of cognitive functions at baseline, and symptoms, cognitive functions and adherence to medication at 1 year, were correlated with scores on social relations and activities of daily living (ADL) (outcome) at 1 year. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to confirm the independent contribution of baseline and concurrent variables to functional outcome at 1 year. Results. Scores on functioning related to social relations and ADL were both significantly correlated with pre-morbid adjustment, all dimensions of residual positive and negative symptoms and adherence to medication at 1 year. Scores on social relations were also modestly correlated with DUP and several cognitive measures at baseline and 1 year (verbal IQ, attention, visual memory, word fluency and working memory). Hierarchical regression confirmed independent contribution of pre-morbid adjustment, total residual symptoms and adherence to medication at 1 year for both dimensions of outcome, and psychomotor poverty and working memory for social relations. Conclusions. In addition to pre-morbid adjustment potentially malleable variables such as level of residual (but not acute) symptoms, adherence to medication and cognitive deficits are likely to influence outcome on aspects of community functioning in individuals treated for first episode of psychosis.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive Function,161

Data (N = 1,307) were combined to accrue a sufficient number of children who attended high-quality child-care centers who were from impoverished families or minority ethnic backgrounds to reliably compare their developmental outcomes with those of children in poorer quality care. Children's behavior, language skills, and preacademic skills were analyzed as a function of child-care quality (low-, medium-, and high-quality groups based on the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale total scores), background risk factors, and parental attitudes to test hypotheses about risk and protective factors. Results provide further support for the hypothesis that quality of child care is related to children's development for all children and quite limited support that child-care quality may matter more for children experiencing social risk factors. Language development was the only outcome in which child-care quality interacted with a risk variable, ethnicity, suggesting that quality of care is differentially more important for language development for children of color than for White-non-Hispanic children.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive Function,284

We hypothesize that chronic debt impairs psychological functioning and decision-making, contributing to the poverty trap. This is because debt is not considered fungible and is viewed as costly mental accounts that consume cognitive bandwidth. We test this using quasiexperimental evidence from a one-off, unanticipated debt-relief program worth several months’ household income. Comparing the poor before and after debt relief, those with more debt accounts paid off experienced greater improvements in cognitive functioning, reported less anxiety, and became less present-biased.

However, these long term effects were mostly explained by the effects of adversity on childhood or adolescent cognitive ability or by differences in educational attainment and adult social class. An exception was the effect of poor material home conditions on visual search speed at 53 years, which was maintained after controlling for adolescent ability, as well as further control for educational attainment, adult social class, physical growth, cigarette smoking, and affective state. There was no evidence of more rapid decline in memory and psychomotor function across middle age in those exposed to early adversity. <b>Conclusions:</b> The effect of early adversity on cognitive function tracks across the life course at least as far as middle age, although there was little evidence from this study of effect amplification over this interval.

We assessed a nationally representative sample of 3–6‐year‐old children (n = 1332) from 150 communities of Madagascar using standard tests of development. We found that children whose families were in the top wealth quintile or whose mothers had secondary education performed significantly better across almost all measures of cognitive and language development and had better linear growth compared with children of women in the lowest wealth quintile or women with no education. These differences between children of low and high socioeconomic position were greatest for receptive language, working memory, and memory of phrases. The mean difference in the scores between children in the highest and lowest socioeconomic status categories doubled between age 3 and age 6, and the biggest gaps across socioeconomic position by age 6 were in receptive language and sustained attention. Our results suggest that even within the context of extreme poverty, there are strong associations between family socioeconomic status and child development outcomes among preschool children, and that the language and executive function domains exhibit the largest gradients.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive Function,206

This study analyzed a large, nationally representative sample of community-dwelling adults ages 50 and older to estimate the relationship between low health literacy and self-reported difficulty obtaining care. We found that individuals with low health literacy were significantly more likely than individuals with adequate health literacy to delay or forgo needed care or to report difficulty finding a provider, even after we controlled for other factors, including health insurance coverage, employment, race/ethnicity, poverty, and general cognitive function. They were also more likely to lack a usual source of care, although this result was only marginally significant after we controlled for other factors.

The results of past prospective studies, when carefully examined, do not consistently support this hypothesis. In the current study, the authors used symptom and neurocognitive data to predict subsequent level of functioning in the community.Neurocognitive and symptom data collected as part of an earlier study were used to predict the community functioning of 50 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Using the Life Skills Profile, staff of a community mental health program assessed community functioning while blind to the earlier symptom ratings and neurocognitive performance.Symptoms were more predictive of community functioning than were neurocognitive measures. Disorganization symptoms were generally more predictive of community functioning than was either psychomotor poverty or reality distortion.The results of this study and of previous longitudinal studies suggest the importance of using symptom levels after optimal treatment, rather than symptoms during acute episodes, as predictors of community functioning. They also indicate the need to evaluate the effects of treatment on disorganization as a separable dimension of symptoms.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive Function,160

We report on the development and initial standardization of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for typological and dimensional assessment. Based on two established psychiatric rating systems, the 30-item PANSS was conceived as an operationalized, drug-sensitive instrument that provides balanced representation of positive and negative symptoms and gauges their relationship to one another and to global psychopathology. It thus constitutes four scales measuring positive and negative syndromes, their differential, and general severity of illness. Study of 101 schizophrenics found the four scales to be normally distributed and supported their reliability and stability. Positive and negative scores were inversely correlated once their common association with general psychopathology was extracted, suggesting that they represent mutually exclusive constructs.

10.1037/bul0000010,Cognitive aspects of young children’s experience of economic disadvantage.,,"Economic disadvantage is a well-studied risk factor for poorer behavioral and academic functioning in young children. Although the mechanisms by which disadvantage impacts children have long been of interest to researchers, studies to date have predominantly focused on mechanisms that are external to the child (e.g., parental depression, marital conflict). Very few studies have examined the internal, cognitive aspects of the experience of economic disadvantage, and almost none have considered how the effects of disadvantage on children's functioning might be mediated through cognitive processes. This article provides a framework for research into cognitive and social-cognitive mediators of economic disadvantage operating in early-to-middle childhood. The initial section of the article briefly reviews and summarizes the extant literature on childhood poverty and its effects. The second section reviews the evidence that preschool-aged children have the requisite cognitive abilities to recognize social inequality in their environments, to be aware of stereotypes related to social class, and to connect these social concepts to their own experience. The third section reviews and evaluates the small literature on children's appraisals, attributions, stereotypes, and perceptions of or about poverty and inequality. The fourth section defines and evaluates the literature on 2 social-cognitive processes-stereotype threat and status anxiety-that are hypothesized to mediate the effects of economic disadvantage on children's functioning.

Other covariates in linear regression models included age, gender, ethnicity, education and poverty, and cardiovascular risk factors.Worse scores on all three measures of oral health status were significantly associated with poorer performance on all three measures of cognitive function after adjustment for age. Education was an important confounding factor. However, after full adjustment for all other covariates, gingival bleeding (%) and loss of periodontal attachment (%) remained associated with relative impairment on SDST score (B coefficients both = 0.003), and gingival bleeding was associated with relative impairment on SDLT (B = 0.017). No effect modification by age was observed.Poor oral health is associated with worse cognitive function throughout adult life.

10.2307/3089239,Meritocracy and Economic Inequality,,"Most Americans strongly favor equality of opportunity if not outcome, but many are weary of poverty's seeming immunity to public policy. This helps to explain the recent attention paid to cultural and genetic explanations of persistent poverty, including claims that economic inequality is a function of intellectual ability, as well as more subtle depictions of the United States as a meritocracy where barriers to achievement are personal--either voluntary or inherited--rather than systemic. This volume of original essays by luminaries in the economic, social, and biological sciences, however, confirms mounting evidence that the connection between intelligence and inequality is surprisingly weak and demonstrates that targeted educational and economic reforms can reduce the income gap and improve the country's aggregate productivity and economic well-being. It also offers a novel agenda of equal access to valuable associations.Amartya Sen, John Roemer, Robert M. Hauser, Glenn Loury, Orley Ashenfelter, and others sift and analyze the latest arguments and quantitative findings on equality in order to explain how merit is and should be defined, how economic rewards are distributed, and how patterns of economic success persist across generations. Moving well beyond exploration, they draw specific conclusions that are bold yet empirically grounded, finding that schooling improves occupational success in ways unrelated to cognitive ability, that IQ is not a strong independent predictor of economic success, and that people's associations--their neighborhoods, working groups, and other social ties--significantly explain many of the poverty traps we observe.The optimistic message of this beautifully edited book is that important violations of equality of opportunity do exist but can be attenuated by policies that will serve the general economy. Policy makers will read with interest concrete suggestions for crafting economically beneficial anti-discrimination measures, enhancing educational and associational opportunity, and centering economic reforms in community-based institutions.

Direct assessments of executive function, effortful control, and stress response physiology (indexed by resting levels of cortisol and alpha amylase obtained from saliva) were measured at child age 48 months and parents and teachers reported on children's effortful control using temperament rating scales at child age approximately 60 months. Math and reading ability, as measured by the Woodcock-Johnson III applied problems and letter-word subtests, respectively, were measured at prekindergarten through the second grade. Effects for self-regulation measures were seen primarily for initial level and to some extent growth in both mathematics and reading, even when controlling for family demographic characteristics that represent relevant selection factors into higher levels of both self-regulation and academic achievement. These effects persisted for mathematics but not for reading with the inclusion of child cognitive abilities, vocabulary, and speed of processing measured in prekindergarten, concurrent with the first time point for the academic measures. Results are interpreted as indicating a role for self-regulation in learning ability generally, likely through support for attention and reasoning abilities that are most specific to the assessment of mathematics in this analysis. Implications for instruction and for assessment and the best ways to support the development of early math and reading ability for children at risk for school failure are discussed.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive Function,217

Evaluations were conducted in laboratory and home settings using observations, maternal self-report, and standardized testing of the children. Scores on physical, psychological, and environmental neglect were combined into a Cumulative Neglect Index. Regression analyses were run to examine the association of specific subtypes of neglect and of cumulative neglect with children’s functioning at age 3, controlling for group, sociodemographic risk, and maternal depression. The analyses were repeated examining the impact on child outcomes at age 5, controlling for the above 3 variables as well as the children’s cognitive development and behavior at age 3. Results. Of the subtypes of neglect at age 3, only psychological neglect was significantly associated with increased internalizing and externalizing behavior problems at age 3; the Cumulative Neglect Index was associated with internalizing problems. None of the neglect subtypes or cumulative neglect were predictive of changes in children’s behavior and development between ages 3 and 5. Cognitive development of the entire sample was impaired at age 5, averaging 0.85 standard deviations below the norm, and their average externalizing behavior score was significantly problematic with an average of 0.60 standard deviations above the norm. Conclusions. In the context of poverty where many preschool children have poor cognitive development and increased behavior problems, psychological neglect is significantly related to reported behavior problems. Children who experienced multiple types of neglect had increased internalizing problems. Neglect did not explain changes in children’s behavior or development between ages 3 and 5. There is a need for pediatricians to identify and address child neglect, particularly psychological neglect, as early as possible. Pediatricians should also screen for maternal depression.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive Function,162

In addition, mediations of several sociodemographic variables, identified in the literature as part of the experience of child poverty, between socioeconomic status and cognitive performance were assessed. Results show: (1) significant differences in performance between groups in most dependent variables analyzed – however, not in all variables associated with attentional control domains; (2) significant indirect effects of literacy activities on working memory and fluid processing domains, as well as computer resources effects on fluid processing; and (3) marginal indirect effects of computer resources on attentional control and working memory domains. These findings extend analysis of the impact of poverty on the development of executive control, through information based on the assessment of combined neurocognitive paradigms and the identification of specific environmental mediators.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognition,72

Our analysis uses data from an experiment, which randomly assigned low-income individuals to perform a cognitive test before or after payday. On average, and based on traditional subgroup analysis, the experiment did not suggest that the poorer financial circumstances before payday impeded cognitive function. Using the causal forest method, however, our heterogeneity analysis suggests that there are indeed detrimental effects among young and elderly individuals with very low incomes. We can confirm this finding in an independent experiment, using only traditional subgroup analysis.German Abstract: Wir untersuchen, ob schlechte finanzielle Umstände heterogene Effekte auf kognitive Funktion haben. Hierfür haben wir Daten aus einem Experiment ausgewertet, in welchem einkommensschwache Individuen einen kognitiven Test vor oder nach Erhalt ihrer Löhne absolvierten.

Even if children's reading skills seem to be related to their socioeconomic status, only a few studies have examined how SES is related to the development of reading skills in children facing severe poverty. This study traced 322 Roma children facing severe poverty from 7 through 9 years and compared them with an unselected sample of 178 Romanian non-Roma children. The Roma children had both poorer initial reading and a slower growth of their reading skills. In contrast to previous studies, SES did explain growth in reading skills after controlling for other well-known cognitive and linguistic predictors of reading. Among the Roma children, the effects of SES on reading growth were partly mediated by school absence. Thus, interventions directed at Roma children facing severe poverty need to target both the quality of reading instruction and broader aspects of these children's lives.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognition,80

Given high levels of racial segregation and elevated rates of Black poverty, it is axiomatically true that African Americans will experience more neighborhood poverty than other groups. Moreover, because poverty is associated with crime and delinquency, they will also be exposed to far higher rates of social disorder and violence. In this article I argue that long-term exposure to social disorder and violence because of segregation produces a high allostatic load among African Americans, which leads, in turn, to a variety of deleterious health and cognitive outcomes. After summarizing recent research on stress and allostatic load, I specify a biosocial model of racial stratification and draw upon it to explicate well-documented racial differentials with respect to health and cognition.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognition,336

To identify characteristics of noninstitutionalized adults with six specific disability types (hearing, vision, cognition, mobility, self-care, and independent living),* and to assess disability-specific disparities in health care access, CDC analyzed 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data. The prevalences of disability overall and by disability type, and access to health care by disability type, were estimated. Analyses were stratified by three age groups: 18-44 years (young adults), 45-64 years (middle-aged adults), and ≥65 years (older adults). Among young adults, cognitive disability (10.6%) was the most prevalent type. Mobility disability was most prevalent among middle-aged (18.1%) and older adults (26.9%). Generally, disability prevalences were higher among women, American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN), adults with income below the federal poverty level (FPL), and persons in the South U.S. Census region. Disability-specific disparities in health care access were prevalent, particularly among young and middle-aged adults.

Specifically, we examine the distinction between practical and discursive consciousness (or declarative and non-declarative culture), and issues of agency. We show how this theoretical process is accomplished in the organization by providing people with the opportunity to change their habits, skills, ""cultured capacities"" and ""repertoires,"" which can help them get out of poverty. We also show other factors, such as social support, are crucial and how the overall process works more for some than for others.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognition,7

Why are warfare metaphors so common, and what are the potential benefits and costs to using them to frame important social and political issues? We address these questions in a detailed case study by reviewing the empirical literature on the subject and by advancing our own theoretical account of the structure and function of war metaphors in public discourse. We argue that war metaphors are omnipresent because (a) they draw on basic and widely shared schematic knowledge that efficiently structures our ability to reason and communicate about many different types of situations, and (b) they reliably express an urgent, negatively valenced emotional tone that captures attention and motivates action. Nevertheless, we find that the meaning (and consequences) of war metaphors is intimately tied to the context in which they are used, which may result in either positive or negative outcomes, depending on the situation. Thus, blanket statements about whether or not a war frame is useful are misguided or overly constraining. Here we situate our case study results in relation to popular theories of metaphoric representation and processing and offer some guidelines for using a war framing effectively. This work helps illuminate the complex, dynamic, and nuanced functions of metaphor in cognition in general, and in public discourse in particular.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognition,351

Difficulty occurred across domains with the same prevalence as difficulty with a single domain; specific difficulty was distributed similarly across domains. Multivariate profile analysis on cognitive dimensions and chi-square tests on demographics showed that specific computational difficulty was associated with strength in language and weaknesses in attentive behavior and processing speed; problem-solving difficulty was associated with deficient language as well as race and poverty.

Our results are consistent with recent experimental results in the neurobiological literature linking exogenous exposure to stress hormones in utero with declines in offspring cognitive, behavioral, and motor development. Moreover, we find that not only are mothers with low levels of human capital characterized by higher and more variable cortisol levels but that the negative impact of elevated cortisol on their offspring is greater.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between cognitive function, symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in schizophrenia. Method: This cross-sectional study measured cognition, positive and negative symptom severity, and quality of life (measured with the Quality of Life Scale) in 57 outpatients with schizophrenia. Correlations between the different measures were sought. Multiple regression analyses were used to develop models of the contributions of cognitive deficits and symptomatology to QOL. Results: More severe positive and negative symptoms and cognitive impairment each correlated with poorer QOL. There was a moderate association between negative symptoms and cognition and a small association between positive symptoms and cognition. Age, gender, and drug and alcohol abuse did not significantly predict QOL. In the multiple regression analysis, entering the total cognition and total symptom scores produced a model that accounted for an additional 57% of the variance in QOL. Conclusions: Improving quality of life for people with schizophrenia requires that positive and negative symptoms and cognition are each addressed as separate domains of impairment. But, given that these account for only 57% of the variance in QOL, other factors such as unemployment, poverty, social isolation and stigma may also be important.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognition,103

This article examines the impact of Legacy on children's cognitive and language development (intelligence quotient [IQ], achievement, language skills, and early reading skills) using both standardized assessments and parent-reported indictors through third grade. Methods: Data were collected from 2001 to 2014 from 541 mother-child dyads who were recruited into the 2 concurrent randomized controlled trials of Legacy in Miami and Los Angels. Cognitive and/or language outcomes of children were assessed annually from age 2 to 5 years as well as during a follow-up visit in the third grade. Results: Children experiencing Legacy at the Los Angeles site had significantly higher IQ and achievement scores at 2 and 6 years postintervention, equivalent to approximately one-third of an SD (4 IQ points). IQ results persisted over time, and the difference between intervention and comparison groups on achievement scores widened. There were no significant differences in cognitive outcomes in the Miami sample. There were no significant differences in language outcomes for either site. Conclusion: Legacy shows evidence of effectiveness as an intervention to prevent cognitive delays among children living in poverty. The mixed findings across sites may not only reflect the impact of heterogeneous risk profiles noted by other intervention research programs but also warrant additional study.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognition,4

The purpose of this study was to determine if there are differences in cognitive decline among racial and ethnic older adults.Data were from the Health and Retirement Study, waves 1998-2010. Participants were community dwelling at baseline (n = 9,492), mostly female participants (58.8%), ranged in age from 65 to 105 years (M = 74.41, SD = 6.97), and had education levels that averaged less than high school (M = 11.7, SD = 3.4). Cognition was examined using a combined score from word recall, Serial 7's, backward counting, and naming tasks. To determine changes in cognition across 12 years, we utilized mixed effects models.Results indicated that after adjusting for covariates, race or ethnicity was unrelated to changes in cognitive performance, but there were significant differences in baseline cognition and these differences were more pronounced after adjusting for age, gender, education, poverty, heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure.It is evident that there are significant differences in baseline cognition, although the rate of cognitive decline across 12 years did not vary significantly by race.

However, the relative contributions of the various SES factors on brain development and the mediating effects between cognition and brain morphometry have not been investigated. Here we used cross-sectional data from the ABCD Study to evaluate associations among various SES and demographic factors, brain morphometrics, and cognition and their reproducibility in two independent subsamples of 3892 children. Among the SES factors, family income (FI) best explained individual differences in cognitive test scores (stronger for crystallized than for fluid cognition), cortical volume (CV), and thickness (CT). Other SES factors that showed significant associations with cognition and brain morphometrics included parental education and neighborhood deprivation, but when controlling for FI, their effect sizes were negligible and their regional brain patterns were not reproducible. Mediation analyses showed that cognitive scores, which we used as surrogate markers of the children's level of cognitive stimulation, partially mediated the association of FI and CT, whereas the mediations of brain morphometrics on the association of FI and cognition were not significant. These results suggest that lack of supportive/educational stimulation in children from low-income families might drive the reduced CV and CT. Thus, strategies to enhance parental supportive stimulation and the quality of education for children in low-income families could help counteract the negative effects of poverty on children's brain development.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognition,86

These positive symptoms can be controlled in most patients by currently-available antipsychotics. Conversely, they are poorly effective against concomitant neurocognitive dysfunction, deficits in social cognition and negative symptoms (NS), which strongly contribute to poor functional outcome. The precise notion of NS has evolved over the past century, with recent studies – underpinned by novel rating methods – suggesting two major sub-domains: “decreased emotional expression”, incorporating blunted affect and poverty of speech, and “avolition”, which embraces amotivation, asociality and “anhedonia” (inability to anticipate pleasure). Recent studies implicate a dysfunction of frontocortico-temporal networks in the aetiology of NS, together with a disruption of cortico-striatal circuits, though other structures are also involved, like the insular and parietal cortices, amygdala and thalamus. At the cellular level, a disruption of GABAergic–glutamatergic balance, dopaminergic signalling and, possibly, oxytocinergic and cannibinoidergic transmission may be involved. Several agents are currently under clinical investigation for the potentially improved control of NS, including oxytocin itself, N-Methyl-d-Aspartate receptor modulators and minocycline. Further, magnetic-electrical “stimulation” strategies to recruit cortical circuits and “cognitive–behavioural–psychosocial” therapies likewise hold promise. To acquire novel insights into the causes and treatment of NS, experimental study is crucial, and opportunities are emerging for improved genetic, pharmacological and developmental modelling, together with more refined readouts related to deficits in reward, sociality and “expression”. The present article comprises an integrative overview of the above issues as a platform for this Special Issue of European Neuropsychopharmacology in which five clinical and five preclinical articles treat individual themes in greater detail.

In this article, I consider, and reject, several a priori arguments often raised against ‘special nativism’. I then look at some of the arguments and evidence for an emergentist account of second language acquisition (SLA), and show that emergentists have so far failed to take into account, let alone defeat, standard Poverty of the Stimulus arguments for ‘special nativism’, and have equally failed to show how language competence could ‘emerge’.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognition,75

The purpose of this work was to determine cognitive and adaptive behavioral outcomes of children with traumatic brain injury acquired before age 2 years and to compare outcomes between inflicted versus noninflicted brain injury. PATIENTS AND METHODS. All North Carolina children hospitalized in an ICU for a traumatic brain injury before age 2 years between the years 2000 and 2001 were eligible for study entry. A total of 112 surviving children were prospectively identified, 52 (46%) of whom had complete follow-up. Thirty-one control children were recruited from preschool settings. Control subjects were chosen to be demographically similar to case subjects. Child measures of cognition and adaptive behavior at age 3 years were measured and compared between children with and without traumatic brain injury and children with inflicted and noninflicted traumatic brain injury. RESULTS. Sixty percent of injured children were &amp;gt;1 SD below normal on cognitive testing. Forty percent of injured children scored &amp;gt;1 SD below normal on adaptive behavior testing. Children with inflicted traumatic brain injury performed more poorly on tests of cognition and adaptive behavior. Glasgow Coma Scale ≥13, absence of seizures, income above twice the poverty guidelines, and high social capital were associated with improved outcomes. Injured children had lower scores than uninjured control children after adjustment for socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS. Very young children with mild-to-severe traumatic brain injury as measured by the Glasgow Coma Scale are at risk for global cognitive deficits more than a year after the time of injury. Inflicted brain injury is associated with more severe injury and worse outcomes. This is less optimistic than findings in this same cohort 1 year after injury.

10.1086/692290,China’s Invisible Crisis: Cognitive Delays among Rural Toddlers and the Absence of Modern Parenting,,"This article explores the problem of cognitive delays among toddlers in rural China and the role of their caregivers in producing low levels of cognition (i.e., low IQ). According to the results of a well-tested international scale of child development, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID), cognitive delays are alarmingly common, and nearly half the toddlers in our sample score an IQ of less than 84 on the BSID test (more than one standard deviation below the mean). In analyzing the source of this, we find that poor parenting—for example, not reading to, singing with, or engaging in stimulating play with one’s children—is closely associated with these delays. Even though mothers (as opposed to grandmother caregivers), and especially more educated mothers, are more likely to follow good parenting practices, quality parenting is rare overall. We seek to find out why so many young children appear to be neglected when it comes to modern parenting practices. We empirically rule out the hypotheses that caregivers discriminate according to their child’s gender; that the number of children in a given household is associated with the quality of parenting; or that caregivers living in relative poverty parent differently than their wealthier counterparts. According to the qualitative component of our study, we also find that inadequate parenting does not stem from parental indifference. Parents and grandparents obviously love their children and want them to succeed in life. Instead, the barriers appear to be primarily a lack of time and an absence of knowledge about the importance of good parenting practices. As a result, when they grow up, these children may not possess the levels of cognition needed to thrive in China’s increasingly high-skill-based economy. Overall, our findings suggest that China may be facing a national crisis due to inadequate rural early childhood development.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognition,111

The theory started with the rejection of the premise of the poverty of the stimulus, the physicalist conception of the stimulus, and the passive character of the perceiver of mainstream theories of perception. On the contrary, the main principles of ecological psychology are the continuity of perception and action, the organism-environment system as unit of analysis, the study of affordances as the objects of perception, combined with an emphasis on perceptual learning and development. In this paper, first, we analyze the philosophical and psychological influences of ecological psychology: pragmatism, behaviorism, phenomenology, and Gestalt psychology. Second, we summarize the main concepts of the approach and their historical development following the academic biographies of the proponents. Finally, we highlight the most significant developments of this psychological tradition. We conclude that ecological psychology is one of the most innovative approaches in the psychological field, as it is reflected in its current influence in the contemporary embodied and situated cognitive sciences, where the notion of affordance and the work of E.J.

We tested the hypothesis that receipt of supportive parenting would offset the association between living in poverty during adolescence and the connectivity of neural networks that support cognition and emotion regulation during young adulthood. In a sample of African American youths ( N = 119) living in the rural South, poverty status and receipt of supportive parenting were assessed when youths were 11 to 13 and 16 to 18 years old. At age 25, resting-state functional connectivity of the central-executive and emotion-regulation neural networks was assessed using functional MRI. The results revealed that more years spent living in poverty presaged less connectivity in both neural networks among young adults who received low levels of supportive parenting but not among those who received high levels of such parenting.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognition,74

Modern humans have a sophisticated ability to make and execute elaborate plans of action, something known in the cognitive science literature as executive functions. Cognitive science has further established that these executive functions are enabled by working memory, an interpretive concept introduced by Alan Baddeley in 1974 and subsequently tested by more than 30 years of intensive research. Recently, Coolidge and Wynn have advanced a controversial hypothesis that it was an enhancement of working‐memory capacity that powered the final evolution of the modern mind. Wenner‐Gren International Symposium 139 met in March 2008 in Cascais, Portugal, to discuss this hypothesis and the evolution of working memory and executive reasoning in general.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognition,105
10.1542/peds.2014-0694,Cognitive Deficit and Poverty in the First 5 Years of Childhood in Bangladesh,,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the timing and size of the cognitive deficit associated with poverty in the first 5 years of life and to examine the role of parental characteristics, pre- and postnatal growth, and stimulation in the home in Bangladeshi children. We hypothesized that the effect of poverty on cognition begins in infancy and is mainly mediated by these factors. METHODS: We enrolled 2853 singletons, a subsample from a pregnancy supplementation trial in a poor rural area. We assessed mental development at 7, 18, and 64 months; anthropometry at birth, 12, 24, and 64 months; home stimulation at 18 and 64 months; and family’s socioeconomic background. In multiple regression analyses, we examined the effect of poverty at birth on IQ at 64 months and the extent that other factors mediated the effect. RESULTS: A mean cognitive deficit of 0.2 (95% confidence interval –0.4 to –0.02) z scores between the first and fifth wealth quintiles was apparent at 7 months and increased to 1.2 (95% confidence interval –1.3 to –1.0) z scores of IQ by 64 months. Parental education, pre- and postnatal growth in length, and home stimulation mediated 86% of the effects of poverty on IQ and had independent effects. Growth in the first 2 years had larger effects than later growth. Home stimulation had effects throughout the period. CONCLUSIONS: Effects of poverty on children’s cognition are mostly mediated through parental education, birth size, growth in the first 24 months, and home stimulation in the first 5 years.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognition,11
10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00550,Executive functioning and reading achievement in school: a study of Brazilian children assessed by their teachers as â€œpoor readersâ€,,"This study examined executive functioning and reading achievement in 106 6- to 8-year-old Brazilian children from a range of social backgrounds of whom approximately half lived below the poverty line. A particular focus was to explore the executive function profile of children whose classroom reading performance was judged below standard by their teachers and who were matched to controls on chronological age, sex, school type (private or public), domicile (Salvador/BA or São Paulo/SP) and socioeconomic status. Children completed a battery of 12 executive function tasks that were conceptual tapping cognitive flexibility, working memory, inhibition and selective attention. Each executive function domain was assessed by several tasks. Principal component analysis extracted four factors that were labeled ""Working Memory/Cognitive Flexibility,"" ""Interference Suppression,"" ""Selective Attention,"" and ""Response Inhibition."" Individual differences in executive functioning components made differential contributions to early reading achievement. The Working Memory/Cognitive Flexibility factor emerged as the best predictor of reading. Group comparisons on computed factor scores showed that struggling readers displayed limitations in Working Memory/Cognitive Flexibility, but not in other executive function components, compared to more skilled readers. These results validate the account that working memory capacity provides a crucial building block for the development of early literacy skills and extends it to a population of early readers of Portuguese from Brazil. The study suggests that deficits in working memory/cognitive flexibility might represent one contributing factor to reading difficulties in early readers. This might have important implications for how educators might intervene with children at risk of academic under achievement.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,76

African Americans and individuals living in poverty may be at greater risk for cognitive decrements from poor diet quality.Cross-sectional.Baltimore, MD, USA.Participants were 2090 African Americans and Whites (57 % female, mean age=47·9 years) who completed two 24 h dietary recalls. We examined cognitive performance and potential interactions of diet quality with race and poverty status using baseline data from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study. Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) scores were calculated and interpreted using federal guidelines. A neurocognitive test battery was administered to evaluate cognitive function over several domains.Linear regression analyses showed that lower HEI-2010 scores were associated with poorer verbal learning and memory (P<0·05) after adjustment for covariates. Diet quality within the sample was poor. Significant interactions of HEI-2010 and poverty status (all P<0·05) indicated that higher diet quality was associated with higher performance on tests of attention and cognitive flexibility, visuospatial ability and perceptual speed among those below the poverty line. No significant race interactions emerged. Higher diet quality was associated with better performance on two measures of verbal learning and memory, irrespective of race and poverty status.Findings suggest that diet quality and cognitive function are likely related at the population level.

We review the evidence base on short- and long-term risks for children during early childhood development (ECD; defining this from prenatal to 8 years of age). We also present evidence-based mitigating program and policy actions that may decrease these risks. Maternal and child mortality and morbidity are predicted to increase in the short run, not only directly from COVID-19-related illness, but also as critical resources are directed away from primary care to respond to the pandemic. Early results from a nationally representative phone survey in the US show that more than one-third of parents of children less than 6 years of age reported delaying health care visits.7Fisher P.

This circumstance has the potential to begin to reverse the enormous progress made by prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs, especially in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, where rates of maternal infection remain high. Interruptions to the vaccination schedule in early childhood could have short- and long-term ramifications for children's health. Furthermore, as has been experienced during the HIV epidemic, illness, hospitalization, separation, and loss of caregivers have immediate harmful effects on young children's health, nutrition, well-being, and learning. These effects can occur even in the absence of infection or symptoms among children. Deteriorating economic circumstances will further exacerbate immediate health, nutrition, care, and education risks. It is estimated that the pandemic can lead this year to an additional 42 to 66 million children who live in extreme poverty, and that the economic shocks experienced by families because of the global economic downturn could reverse the last 2 to 3 years of progress in decreasing infant mortality.8United Nations Policy brief: the impact of COVID-19 on children.https://unsdg.un.org/resources/policy-brief-impact-covid-19-childrenDate accessed: April 28, 2020Google Scholar Families may lose wages and housing, and have to bear the costs of increased health care and associated food insecurity. Low-income households quickly deplete savings and sell assets to provide better food and treatment for ill household members. As in prior economic crises, widespread loss of employment and increases in poverty drive further migration, displacement, and family separations, which severely affects early childhood nutrition, care, and development.9Waddoups A.B.

Parenting and family factors are the critical drivers of children's early healthy growth and development and are thus primary in determining the immediate severity of pandemic impacts on young children now and in the future. In crisis situations, primary caregivers and parents struggle to keep up with providing health, nutrition, safety, and care of children. For those household already living in conditions of adversity and stress, this crisis may have particularly harmful effects. And with many childcare and early education facilities closed worldwide, and interactions with extended families disrupted, children are deprived of both social and cognitive stimulation beyond their homes, in addition to the meals and other resources provided by many ECD programs.

In the longer run, children at risk academically could be further disadvantaged if they do not have parents who can support their learning process at home. Therefore, media-based learning platforms should be accompanied by outreach to caregivers and parents. Third, the unique challenges of COVID-19 require further integration of family support with the realities of distancing, quarantine, isolation, and, in too many cases, loss. COVID-19-related awareness can accompany ECD awareness and supports for parental well-being and responsive caregiving. When distancing within households is indicated, separation of children from caregivers should only occur when absolutely necessary; when it does occur, communication between children and caregivers should be maintained as much as possible. For those households that experience loss of or serious illness in a caregiver, the approach to communicating this to children should build on evidence-based principles.58Stein A. Dalton L. Rapa E.

However, research shows that even children as young as 2 years are aware of changes around them, get upset when a caregiver leaves, and seek their return; toddlers also notice and react to distress expressed around them. Children's understanding of illness and death evolves throughout childhood.59Dalton L. Rapa E. Stein A.

Sensitive and effective communication has considerable benefits for children and their family's long-term psychological well-being. Attention to the most vulnerable populations requires unprecedented coordination of these services, owing to these groups' even more challenging contexts.

Poverty, risky behaviours, vacillating motivation, and cognitive impairments are additional problems facing many individuals with triple diagnoses. In many communities the service system is inadequately prepared to serve this population. Treatment barriers include stigma associated with the three illnesses, separate funding streams, and lack of co-ordination between medical, mental health, and substance abuse treatment facilities. This paper discusses strategies for recruiting, engaging, and retaining individuals with triple diagnoses in both treatment and research. Recruitment strategies should be directed at both professionals and individuals with triple diagnoses themselves. Recruiting and engaging these individuals in treatment requires that comprehensive services be provided on a 24-hour basis in a flexible and culturally competent manner. A team approach is often the most effective way of providing such services. Retaining individuals with triple diagnoses in a longitudinal research study requires multiple strategies including the collection of detailed tracking information, outreach workers, and financial incentives for completing the interviews.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,51

10.2307/2657556,How Much Does Childhood Poverty Affect the Life Chances of Children?,,This study examines the impact of the level of income and the timing of economic deprivation in childhood on completed schooling in the US. Data were obtained from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics among a sample of 1323 children born during 1967 and 1973 and 328 sibling pairs. The average level of income increased across childhood. Income at ages 11-15 years was about 40% higher than income at ages 0-5 years. Only 39% of children with family incomes below $15000 in early childhood had incomes that low in adolescence. Almost 50% of siblings had 15-year average incomes that differed by over $5000. Multivariate analysis reveals that children with family incomes of $15000-25000 completed .82 years more schooling had 4.1 times greater odds of completing high school and had an insignificantly lower risk of a nonmarital birth. At the next higher income level children had a half a year higher schooling level than children with income of $15000-25000. A $10000 increase to income averaged over the 0-5 years of life for children in low-income families was associated with a .81 year increase in completed schooling and a 2.9 times increase in the odds of finishing high school. These estimated effects were larger than at ages 6-10 years and 11-15 years. Parental income during adolescence was less important in the completion of high school and more important for college decisions. Children with early childhood family incomes of $15000-25000 averaged .66 years more schooling than children in the lowest income group. Stage-specific income from all childhood stages did not strongly predict nonmarital childbearing. High income during adolescence enabled children to enter college but did not predict completion of college. Sibling findings supported the individual-based findings that economic conditions in early childhood particularly among low-income families were key determinants of completed schooling.,Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,1614

We must also distinguish the theory from the resource‐based and evolutionary views. The paper begins with a multitype epistemology which admits both the pre‐ and subconscious modes of human knowing and, reframing the concept of the cognizing individual, the collective knowledge of social groups. While both Nelson and Winter, and Nonaka and Takeuchi, successfully sketch theories of the dynamic interactions of these types of organizational knowledge, neither indicates how they are to be contained. Callon and Latour suggest knowledge itself is dynamic and contained within actor networks, so moving us from knowledge as a resource toward knowledge as a process. To simplify this approach, we revisit sociotechnical systems theory, adopt three heuristics from the social constructionist literature, and make a distinction between the systemic and component attributes of the actor network. The result is a very different mode of theorizing, less an objective statement about the nature of firms ‘out there’ than a tool to help managers discover their place in the firm as a dynamic knowledge‐based activity system.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,4218

Guided by the polyvagal perspective, we tested whether children's VRC is associated with attenuated sympathetic nervous system (SNS) stress reactivity in socially supportive conditions. Sixty-one 4- to 5-year-old children living in poverty underwent two standardized laboratory stress induction procedures. Cardiac vagal reactivity (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) to a first set of stressors (social, cognitive, physical, and emotional) indexed VRC. During a second set of stressors, participants were randomly assigned to a supportive or nonsupportive social context, and cardiac sympathetic reactivity (preejection period) was assessed. We hypothesized VRC would predict lower SNS stress reactivity, but only in the socially supportive context. Children with high VRC showed attenuated SNS stress reactivity in the socially supportive context compared to children with high VRC in the nonsupportive context and children with low VRC in either context. Individual differences in VRC predict attenuated SNS stress reactivity in socially supportive conditions. Understanding how social support and VRC jointly mitigate SNS stress reactivity may further efforts to prevent negative health outcomes. Implications for biological sensitivity to context and differential susceptibility theories are discussed.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,29

Precarious work constitutes a global challenge that has a wide range of consequences cutting across many areas of concern to sociologists. Hence, it is increasingly important to understand the new workplace arrangements that generate precarious work and worker insecurity. A focus on employment relations forms the foundation of theories of the institutions and structures that generate precarious work and the cultural and individual factors that influence people's responses to uncertainty.

A leading estimand in this class is the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). Data combination problems are related to, but distinct from, the class of missing data problems with data missing at random (of which the average treatment effect (ATE) estimand is a special case). Our estimator also possesses a double robustness property. Our procedure may be used to efficiently estimate, among other objects, the ATT, the two-sample instrumental variables model (TSIV), counterfactual distributions, poverty maps, and semiparametric difference-in-differences. In an empirical application, we use our procedure to characterize residual Black–White wage inequality after flexibly controlling for ""premarket"" differences in measured cognitive achievement.

Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good ones, and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good. The self is more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones. Bad impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to disconfirmation than good ones. Various explanations such as diagnosticity and salience help explain some findings, but the greater power of bad events is still found when such variables are controlled.

Income may be evaluated relative to others (social comparison) or to oneself in the past (habituation). We review the evidence on relative income from the subjective well-being literature. We also discuss the relation (or not) between happiness and utility, and discuss some nonhappiness research (behavioral, experimental, neurological) related to income comparisons.

10.1542/peds.2011-2663,The Lifelong Effects of Early Childhood Adversity and Toxic Stress,,"This Technical Report was retired November 2021. Advances in fields of inquiry as diverse as neuroscience, molecular biology, genomics, developmental psychology, epidemiology, sociology, and economics are catalyzing an important paradigm shift in our understanding of health and disease across the lifespan. This converging, multidisciplinary science of human development has profound implications for our ability to enhance the life prospects of children and to strengthen the social and economic fabric of society. Drawing on these multiple streams of investigation, this report presents an ecobiodevelopmental framework that illustrates how early experiences and environmental influences can leave a lasting signature on the genetic predispositions that affect emerging brain architecture and long-term health. The report also examines extensive evidence of the disruptive impacts of toxic stress, offering intriguing insights into causal mechanisms that link early adversity to later impairments in learning, behavior, and both physical and mental well-being. The implications of this framework for the practice of medicine, in general, and pediatrics, specifically, are potentially transformational. They suggest that many adult diseases should be viewed as developmental disorders that begin early in life and that persistent health disparities associated with poverty, discrimination, or maltreatment could be reduced by the alleviation of toxic stress in childhood. An ecobiodevelopmental framework also underscores the need for new thinking about the focus and boundaries of pediatric practice. It calls for pediatricians to serve as both front-line guardians of healthy child development and strategically positioned, community leaders to inform new science-based strategies that build strong foundations for educational achievement, economic productivity, responsible citizenship, and lifelong health.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,4380

This two-volume study of the effects of poor urban neighborhoods on families makes a stimulating contribution to related theory, research, public policies, and programs. Its emphasis on human development in an ecological context is part of a welcome and growing trend. See, for example, Phyllis Moen, Glen H. Elder, and Kurt Luscher (1955), and Greg J. Duncan and Jeanne Brooks-Gunn (1977). The contents of the present volumes are so rich that it is impossible to do justice to them here. Volume I is chiefly a report and discussion of large, multidisciplinary studies of neighborhood and influences on the cognitive, behavioral, and educational outcomes of children and adolescents at various stages of their development. It also includes chapters on conceptual issues and implications of findings for federal policies. Volume II explores theories about poverty, urban ecology, research methods, public policies, and programs at state and local levels. These books were developed under the auspices of the Social Science Research Council. Further funding was provided by a number of foundations. The project's goal was to establish a research program to improve understanding of the causes and consequences of persistent, concentrated poverty and to build a base for the design and implementation of better policies and programs. The multidisciplinary research group of social scientists came from a variety of universities. The undertaking was sparked by the work of Urie Bronfenbrenner (1979) and by W. J. Wilson's book (1987) on the severe effects of urban poverty on neighborhoods. The group, in an extensive review of past research, concluded that the research showed only weak and inconsistent evidence of the effects of neighborhood composition on individual outcomes. It decided, therefore, to attempt to develop new theory, concepts, methods, and empirical findings that would guide further research. A variety of analyses of six existing data sets were carried out. Three of these sets included national, longitudinal data-the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the National Longitudinal Study of Youth, and the Infant Health and Development Program. The other three sets were more local in nature. All included Black, White, and Hispanic participants. Census data provided information about neighborhoods, including socioeconomic levels of the population, ethnic diversity, rates of male joblessness, and family concentration. Important information not available included community resources such as schools and social services. Rates of crime and housing characteristics also were not provided. The authors comment at length on the inadequacy of census tract data for a true understanding of neighborhoods. However, the data were the best available. Family, child, and adolescent information from the various data sets was variable, but generally included demographic characteristics, headship, income, and maternal education and hours of employment. Some of the sets also provided information about the learning environment of the home and levels of maternal warmth, coping behaviors, depression, and social support. Information about child development outcomes differed by data set. These sets included various measures of intelligence and educational and psychosocial behaviors of children at different ages. The authors discuss deficiencies in these data and recommend ways to improve them. Results of multiple regression analysis are presented in exquisite detail in numerous tables and graphs. A summary of findings shows that neighborhood conditions often are significant predictors of aspects of child development. …",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,776

This study examined 259 public school students in third and fifth grades and found that field tests of physical fitness were positively related to academic achievement. Specifically, aerobic capacity was positively associated with achievement, whereas BMI was inversely related. Associations were demonstrated in total academic achievement, mathematics achievement, and reading achievement, thus suggesting that aspects of physical fitness may be globally related to academic performance in preadolescents. The findings are discussed with regards to maximizing school performance and the implications for educational policies.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,848

These early experiences can affect adult health in 2 ways—either by cumulative damage over time or by the biological embedding of adversities during sensitive developmental periods. In both cases, there can be a lag of many years, even decades, before early adverse experiences are expressed in the form of disease.

George Bonanno, Ann Masten, Catherine Panter-Brick, and Rachel Yehuda tackle some of the most pressing current questions in the field of resilience research including: (1) how do we define resilience, (2) what are the most important determinants of resilience, (3) how are new technologies informing the science of resilience, and (4) what are the most effective ways to enhance resilience? These multidisciplinary experts provide insight into these difficult questions, and although each of the panelists had a slightly different definition of resilience, most of the proposed definitions included a concept of healthy, adaptive, or integrated positive functioning over the passage of time in the aftermath of adversity. The panelists agreed that resilience is a complex construct and it may be defined differently in the context of individuals, families, organizations, societies, and cultures. With regard to the determinants of resilience, there was a consensus that the empirical study of this construct needs to be approached from a multiple level of analysis perspective that includes genetic, epigenetic, developmental, demographic, cultural, economic, and social variables. The empirical study of determinates of resilience will inform efforts made at fostering resilience, with the recognition that resilience may be enhanced on numerous levels (e.g., individual, family, community, culture).",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,2065

Cette théorie distingue trois types d’action: l’action personnelle exercée individuellement, l’action par procuration où l’on s’assure de bénéﬁces désirés en incitant autrui a intervenir en sa faveur, et l’action collective où les gens agissent ensemble pour construire leur avenir. Des dichotomies conﬂictuelles parsèment notre domaine, opposant l’autonomie et l’interdépendance, l’individualisme et le collectivisme. Les déterminants et les doses d’action individuelle, par procuration et collective varient culturellement. Mais tous les modes d’action sont nécessaires pour parvenir á ses ﬁns quel que soit le contexte culturel. Les cultures sont diverses et dynamiques, ce ne sont pas des monolithes statiques. La diversité intraculturelle et les écarts dans les orientations psychosociales mettent en évidence la dynamique aux multiples facettes des cultures. La globalisation croissante, la pluralité des sociétés et l’immersion dans un monde virtuel qui se joue du temps, des distances, des lieux et des frontières incitent àélargir la portée des études interculturelles. Les préoccupations se focalisent sur la façon dont les forces nationales et globales interagissent dans la création de la vie culturelle. Social cognitive theory adopts an agentic perspective to human development, adaptation, and change. The theory distinguishes among three modes of agency: personal agency exercised individually; proxy agency in which people secure desired outcomes by inﬂuencing others to act on their behalf; and collective agency in which people act in concert to shape their future. Contentious dualisms pervade our ﬁeld pitting autonomy against interdependence; individualism against collectivism and communality; and personal agency against social structure. The determinants and agentic blends of individual, proxy, and collective instrumentality vary cross‐culturally. But all agentic modes are needed to make it through the day whatever the cultural context in which one resides. Cultures are diverse and dynamic social systems not static monoliths. Intracultural diversity and intraindividual variation in psychosocial orientations across spheres of functioning underscore the multifaceted dynamic nature of cultures. The growing globalisation and cultural pluralisation of societies and enmeshment in a cyberworld that transcends time, distance, place, and national borders call for broadening the scope of cross‐cultural analyses.

EBPS programs have been at the cutting edge of global dissemination efforts to increase community access to evidence-based parenting programs. Despite the widely recognised success of these efforts, existing models of parenting intervention are not a panacea, and much can be done to improved outcomes. Efforts to improve outcomes have included the emergence of a population-based approach to increase reach of intervention. This has included the development of flexible delivery modalities, including online parenting interventions, the incorporation of strategies to enhance cultural relevance and acceptability of programs, and more recently, applications with parents in very low resource settings. Further enhancements of outcomes are likely to be forthcoming as we gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that explain positive intervention effects and non-response to interventions. More cost-effective online professional training models are needed to disseminate and promote the sustained use of EBPS programs. New interventions are required for the most vulnerable parents when parenting concerns are complicated by other problems such as trauma, addictions, relationship conflict, family violence, mental health problems and intergenerational poverty. However, to scale effective programs, Commonwealth and state government policies and funding priorities need to respond to evidence about what works and make sustained investments in the implementation of parenting programs. Possible strategies to enhance the policy impact of intervention research are discussed.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,16

10.2307/2657415,The Wage Penalty for Motherhood,,"Motherhood is associated with lower hourly pay, but the causes of this are not well understood. Mothers may earn less than other women because having children causes them to (1) lose job experience, (2) be less productive at work, (3) trade off higher wages for mother-friendly jobs, or (4) be discriminated against by employers. Or the relationship may be spurious rather than causal-women with lower earning potential may have children at relatively higher rates. The authors use data from the 1982-1993 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth with fixed-effects models to examine the wage penalty for motherhood. Results show a wage penalty of 7 percent per child. Penalties are larger for married women than for unmarried women. Women with (more) children have fewer years of job experience, and after controlling for experience a penalty of 5 percent per child remains. Mother-friendly characteristics of the jobs held by mothers explain little of the penalty beyond the tendency of more mothers than non-mothers to work part-time. The portion of the motherhood penalty unexplained probably results from the effect of motherhood on productivity and/or from discrimination by employers against mothers. While the benefits of mothering diffuse widely-to the employers, neighbors, friends, spouses, and children of the adults who received the mothering-the costs of child rearing are borne disproportionately by mothers.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,1589
10.1017/s0140525x0999094x,The myth of language universals: Language diversity and its importance for cognitive science,,"Abstract Talk of linguistic universals has given cognitive scientists the impression that languages are all built to a common pattern. In fact, there are vanishingly few universals of language in the direct sense that all languages exhibit them. Instead, diversity can be found at almost every level of linguistic organization. This fundamentally changes the object of enquiry from a cognitive science perspective. This target article summarizes decades of cross-linguistic work by typologists and descriptive linguists, showing just how few and unprofound the universal characteristics of language are, once we honestly confront the diversity offered to us by the world's 6,000 to 8,000 languages. After surveying the various uses of “universal,” we illustrate the ways languages vary radically in sound, meaning, and syntactic organization, and then we examine in more detail the core grammatical machinery of recursion, constituency, and grammatical relations. Although there are significant recurrent patterns in organization, these are better explained as stable engineering solutions satisfying multiple design constraints, reflecting both cultural-historical factors and the constraints of human cognition. Linguistic diversity then becomes the crucial datum for cognitive science: we are the only species with a communication system that is fundamentally variable at all levels. Recognizing the true extent of structural diversity in human language opens up exciting new research directions for cognitive scientists, offering thousands of different natural experiments given by different languages, with new opportunities for dialogue with biological paradigms concerned with change and diversity, and confronting us with the extraordinary plasticity of the highest human skills.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,2288

Advances in neuroscience suggest that a focus on self-regulation in education can enhance children's engagement in learning and establish beneficial academic trajectories in the early elementary grades. Here, we experimentally evaluate an innovative approach to the education of children in kindergarten that embeds support for self-regulation, particularly executive functions, into literacy, mathematics, and science learning activities. Results from a cluster randomized controlled trial involving 29 schools, 79 classrooms, and 759 children indicated positive effects on executive functions, reasoning ability, the control of attention, and levels of salivary cortisol and alpha amylase. Results also demonstrated improvements in reading, vocabulary, and mathematics at the end of kindergarten that increased into the first grade. A number of effects were specific to high-poverty schools, suggesting that a focus on executive functions and associated aspects of self-regulation in early elementary education holds promise for closing the achievement gap.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Executive control,356
10.1093/ije/dyh372,Cohort Profile: The Whitehall II study,,"The Whitehall studies have come to be closely associated with the investigation of socioeconomic differences in physical and mental illness and mortality: the social gradient.1,2 That was not the initial purpose of the first Whitehall study. Donald Reid and Geoffrey Rose set up Whitehall, in the 1960s, as a kind of British Framingham:3 ‘Framingham’ insofar as it was a longitudinal study of cardiorespiratory disease and diabetes, looking at individual risk factors for disease; ‘British’ in that it was done on the cheap—a simple screening examination with follow-up limited to deaths identified from the National Health Service Central Registry. Socioeconomic differences were initially not on the agenda. In the 1970s there was a small group of researchers who continued the British tradition that went back to William Farr in the nineteenth century of examining social inequalities in health.4 For the most part, within epidemiology, ‘social class’ was not an object of study but a control variable: a potential confounder that you got rid of in order to arrive at the ‘correct’ conclusion about the association between risk factor and disease. To the extent that there was a focus on inequalities in health, the general view was that poor people got diseases of material deprivation and rich people got heart disease and peptic ulcers. If this perception had been true,5,6 Whitehall showed that it was no longer so. In a population of middle-aged men, all employed in stable jobs in the British Civil Service, there was an inverse social gradient in mortality: the lower the grade, the higher the risk of death. Tenyear follow-up showed that there was a steep inverse relation between grade of employment and death from all causes, from coronary heart disease (CHD), and from non-coronary causes.7 The relative risk of death owing to CHD was 2.2 in clerical compared with senior administrative staff, and 1.6 for those in the intermediate professional and executive grade. The first Whitehall study made clear that inequalities in health were not limited to the health consequences of poverty. Important as that issue remains, the Whitehall question was why there should be a social gradient in disease in people above the poverty threshold. When conventional risk factors were controlled for, two-thirds of the mortality risk differential between the clerical and administrative grades remained unexplained.7,8 Mortality gradients in the study were in the same direction as national social class mortality data,9 but larger. We hypothesized that psychosocial factors and aspects of nutrition other than those affecting plasma cholesterol (which was higher in high grades in Whitehall) might fill in the unexplained part of the social gradient in mortality.7 We therefore set up the Whitehall II study, a new longitudinal study of British civil servants, with the explicit intention of examining reasons for the social gradient in health and disease in men and extending the research to include women.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Executive control,759

Furthermore, executive control was found to contribute to variance in emotion knowledge. Even with age, gender, socioeconomic risk status, and executive control covaried, emotion knowledge contributed to variance in social competence. Given these covariates, it contributed only indirectly to classroom adjustment, via its contribution to social competence.

The study utilized a community sample of 306 children (36–40 months) representing the full range of family income, with 29 percent at or near poverty and 28 percent lower income. Two dimensions of effortful control (executive control and delay ability) were assessed at four time points, each separated by nine months, and growth trajectories were examined. Maternal warmth, negativity, limit setting, scaffolding, and responsiveness were observed. Above the effects of child cognitive ability, income, and cumulative risk, scaffolding predicted higher initial levels of executive control that remained higher across the study, and limit setting predicted greater gains in executive control. Parenting did not predict changes in delay ability. Significant indirect effects indicated that scaffolding mediated the effects of income and cumulative risk on growth in executive control. The findings suggest that parenting behaviors can promote effortful control in young children and could be targets of prevention programs in low‐income families.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Executive control,100

It can lead to cognitive distancing, diminish cognitive performance, and cause the poor to forego beneficial programs. In the present research, we examined how self-affirmation can mitigate the stigma of poverty through randomized field experiments involving low-income individuals at an inner-city soup kitchen. Because of low literacy levels, we used an oral rather than written affirmation procedure, in which participants verbally described a personal experience that made them feel successful or proud. Compared with nonaffirmed participants, affirmed individuals exhibited better executive control, higher fluid intelligence, and a greater willingness to avail themselves of benefits programs. The effects were not driven by elevated positive mood, and the same intervention did not affect the performance of wealthy participants. The findings suggest that self-affirmation can improve the cognitive performance and decisions of the poor, and it may have important policy implications.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Executive control,137

10.1542/peds.2006-0003,Diffusion Tensor Imaging of Frontal White Matter and Executive Functioning in Cocaine-Exposed Children,,"BACKGROUND. Although animal studies have demonstrated frontal white matter and behavioral changes resulting from prenatal cocaine exposure, no human studies have associated neuropsychological deficits in attention and inhibition with brain structure. We used diffusion tensor imaging to investigate frontal white matter integrity and executive functioning in cocaine-exposed children. METHODS. Six direction diffusion tensor images were acquired using a Siemens 3T scanner with a spin-echo echo-planar imaging pulse sequence on right-handed cocaine-exposed (n = 28) and sociodemographically similar non-exposed children (n = 25; mean age: 10.6 years) drawn from a prospective, longitudinal study. Average diffusion and fractional anisotropy were measured in the left and right frontal callosal and frontal projection fibers. Executive functioning was assessed using two well-validated neuropsychological tests (Stroop color-word test and Trail Making Test). RESULTS. Cocaine-exposed children showed significantly higher average diffusion in the left frontal callosal and right frontal projection fibers. Cocaine-exposed children were also significantly slower on a visual-motor set-shifting task with a trend toward lower scores on a verbal inhibition task. Controlling for gender and intelligence, average diffusion in the left frontal callosal fibers was related to prenatal exposure to alcohol and marijuana and an interaction between cocaine and marijuana exposure. Performance on the visual-motor set-shifting task was related to prenatal cocaine exposure and an interaction between cocaine and tobacco exposure. Significant correlations were found between test performance and fractional anisotropy in areas of the frontal white matter. CONCLUSIONS. Prenatal cocaine exposure, alone and in combination with exposure to other drugs, is associated with slightly poorer executive functioning and subtle microstructural changes suggesting less mature development of frontal white matter pathways. The relative contribution of postnatal environmental factors, including characteristics of the caregiving environment and stressors associated with poverty and out-of-home placement, on brain development and behavioral functioning in polydrug-exposed children awaits further research.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Executive control,113

Not quite strong enough to control its own destiny, while occupying a strategic location among ambitious and powerful neighbors, Korea has gone through numerous crises in its recent history. Japanese colonization, the devastating Korean War, poverty, and a backward social infrastructure left the country ill prepared to face the modern world. However, these multiple shocks to the nation awakened the Korean people. In less than fifty years since the end of the Korean War, South Korea has transformed itself from a poverty-stricken country into a leading information and communication technology (ICT) country, especially in the most critical areas which support the new e-global age: the high-speed Internet and mobile communication. South Korea's vitality as an ICT hotbed has resulted from a number of factors such as the changing global economic environment, government policies, and Korean cultural characteristics supporting ICT diffusion. The Korean government has made bold investment in technological and human infrastructures. These factors have enabled Korea to establish new competitive strategies for high-tech areas, especially ICT. Korean cultural characteristics that have contributed to a favorable environment for ICT development and diffusion include, among others, valuing efficiency and speed, self-efficacy, a subjective norm of belongingness, and the Korean language.

Both FTD and poverty of speech have been hypothesized to be associated with deficits in executive functioning or cognitive control. The current study examined whether FTD and poverty of speech were differentially associated with two distinct aspects of cognitive control, working memory and controlled retrieval. Compared with control participants (n = 30), people with schizophrenia (n = 47) exhibited poorer performance on both working memory and controlled retrieval tasks. However, only FTD (and not poverty of speech) was associated with poor working memory. In contrast, only poverty of speech (and not FTD) had a significant zero-order association with poor controlled retrieval. At the same time, working memory and controlled retrieval interacted to predict FTD, with the highest amount of FTD associated with both poor working memory and poor controlled retrieval. In contrast, psychometric control tasks were not associated with FTD or poverty of speech.

Sessions were conducted by local teachers trained in a literacy curriculum or Mindfulness + Reflection intervention, which involved calming activities and games that provided opportunities to practice reflection in the context of goal-directed problem solving. EF improved in all groups, but planned contrasts indicated that the Mindfulness + Reflection group significantly outperformed the BAU group at Follow-up (4 weeks post-test). No differences in EF were observed between the BAU and Literacy training groups.

We predicted that differences in the event-related potential (ERP) correlates of executive attention and inhibitory control would account for income differences observed on the executive control battery. Income and ERP measures were related to performance on the executive control battery. However, income was unrelated to ERP measures. The findings suggest that income differences observed in executive control during the preschool period might relate to processes other than executive attention and inhibitory control.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Executive control,26
10.1177/0956797617711640,Preschool Intervention Can Promote Sustained Growth in the Executive-Function Skills of Children Exhibiting Early Deficits,,"This study examined the effects of the Head Start Research-Based, Developmentally Informed (REDI) preschool intervention on growth in children’s executive-function (EF) skills from preschool through third grade. Across 25 Head Start centers, each of 44 classrooms was randomly assigned either to an intervention group, which received enhanced social-emotional and language-literacy components, or to a “usual-practice” control group. Four-year-old children ( N = 356; 25% African American, 17% Latino, 58% European American; 54% girls) were followed for 5 years, and EF skills were assessed annually. Latent-class growth analysis identified high, moderate, and low developmental EF trajectories. For children with low EF trajectories, the intervention improved EF scores in third grade significantly more ( d = 0.58) than in the control group. Children who received the intervention also demonstrated better academic outcomes in third grade than children who did not. Poverty often delays EF development; enriching the Head Start program with an evidence-based curriculum and teaching strategies can reduce early deficits and thereby facilitate school success.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Executive control,78
10.1186/1939-4551-7-12,Allergic diseases and asthma: a global public health concern and a call to action,,"This article was originally published online on 19 May 2014 The prevalence of allergic diseases and asthma are increasing worldwide, particularly in low and middle income countries. Moreover, the complexity and severity of allergic diseases, including asthma, continue to increase especially in children and young adults, who are bearing the greatest burden of these trends. In order to address this major global challenge that threatens health and economies alike it is important to have a global action plan that includes partnerships involving different stakeholders from low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Allergic diseases include life-threatening anaphylaxis, food allergies, certain forms of asthma, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, angioedema, urticaria, eczema, eosinophilic disorders, including eosinophilic esophagitis, and drug and insect allergies. Globally, 300 million people suffer from asthma and about 200 to 250 million people suffer from food allergies [1.Pawankar R, Canonica GW, ST Holgate ST, Lockey RF, Blaiss M: The WAO White Book on Allergy (Update. 2013).Google Scholar]. One tenth of the population suffers from drug allergies and 400 million from rhinitis [1.Pawankar R, Canonica GW, ST Holgate ST, Lockey RF, Blaiss M: The WAO White Book on Allergy (Update. 2013).Google Scholar]. Moreover, allergic diseases commonly occur together in the same individual, one disease with the other. This requires an integrated approach to diagnosis and treatment and greater awareness of the underlying causes amongst family physicians, patients as well as specialists A report from the World Allergy Organization, the WAO White Book on Allergy (originally published in 2011) and updated in 2013[1.Pawankar R, Canonica GW, ST Holgate ST, Lockey RF, Blaiss M: The WAO White Book on Allergy (Update. 2013).Google Scholar] summarizes the burden of allergic diseases worldwide, the risk factors, impact on quality of life of patients, morbidity, mortality, their socio-economic consequences, recommended treatment strategies, future therapies, and the cost-benefit analyses of care services. It also offers “high level” recommendations for action on allergy education for health care professions and enhanced patient service provision. WAO is concerned about the rising global burden of allergic diseases and is committed to increased cooperation at a global level engaging governments and policy makers to channel resources and efforts to recognizing allergic diseases as a public health issue. WAO has updated the original WAO Book on Allergy, in 2013 to contain new information, providing the latest data, evidence, and treatments with a new chapter on Severe Asthma, updated introduction and executive Summary and several updated chapters. For instance, asthma prevalence is rising in several high as well as low and middle income countries and the prevalence and impact of allergic diseases continue to grow. According to the World Health Organization, the number of patients having asthma is 300 million and with the rising trends it is expected to increase to 400 million, by 2025. Patients with asthma and allergic diseases have a reduced quality of life. According to the World Health Organization asthma causes 250,000 deaths annually. Moreover, asthma in infancy often goes unrecognized and thus untreated. In the United States, 23 million people including 7 million children suffer from asthma and the prevalence is increasing. The economic costs of asthma are high both in terms of direct and indirect costs [1.Pawankar R, Canonica GW, ST Holgate ST, Lockey RF, Blaiss M: The WAO White Book on Allergy (Update. 2013).Google Scholar] (Table 1) especially in severe or uncontrolled asthma. In the United States, pediatric asthma results in 14 million missed days of school each year, which in turn result in lost workdays — and lost wages — for caregivers [2.Mellon M. Parasuraman B. Pediatric asthma: improving management to reduce cost of care.J Manag Care Pharm. 2004; 10: 130-141PubMed Google Scholar]. As asthma continues to affect more children in lower-income countries, this will lead long-term consequences for their education and perpetuation of their poverty. We need to find ways to control indoor and outdoor air pollution, to train health care professionals to diagnose and treat asthma in children, and to ensure that asthma medications are affordable for all who need them. Educational programs for self-management of asthma and national efforts to tackle asthma as a public health problem have produced remarkable benefits resulting in dramatic reductions in deaths and hospital admissions [1.Pawankar R, Canonica GW, ST Holgate ST, Lockey RF, Blaiss M: The WAO White Book on Allergy (Update. 2013).Google Scholar, 3.Haahtela T.

Pawankar R et al. Open table in a new tab A few global facts and figures for two common allergic diseases: asthma and rhinitis. The upsurge in the prevalence of allergies is observed as societies become more affluent and urbanized. An increase in environmental risk factors like outdoor and indoor pollution like tobacco smoke combined with reduced biodiversity also contributes to this rise in prevalence. In many low- and middle-income countries including in rural areas in India, people rely on solid fuel (wood, cow dung or crop residues) that they burn in simple stoves or open fires for domestic energy [1.Pawankar R, Canonica GW, ST Holgate ST, Lockey RF, Blaiss M: The WAO White Book on Allergy (Update. 2013).Google Scholar]. Secondhand smoke has become more common as parents become affluent enough to buy cigarettes. Together, these factors generate indoor air pollution that is estimated to be as much as 5 times as severe in poor countries as in rich ones [4.GARD collaborating members: Global Surveillance, Prevention and Control of Chronic Respiratory Diseases: A Comprehensive Approach. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2007:1–112.Google Scholar]. In rural Bangladesh, the prevalence of wheezing in rural children over a 12 month period was 16% [5.Zaman K. Takeuchi H. Md Y. El Arifeen S. Chowdhury H.R. Baqui A.H. Wakai S. Iwata T. Asthma in rural Bangladesh children.Indian J Pediatric. 2007; 74: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar]. The White Book highlights data from China that reports outdoor pollution as a cause of 300,000 deaths annually [1.Pawankar R, Canonica GW, ST Holgate ST, Lockey RF, Blaiss M: The WAO White Book on Allergy (Update. 2013).Google Scholar]. Moreover climate change, reduced biodiversity [6.Haahtela T. Holgate S. Pawankar R. Akdis C.A. Benjaponpitak S. Caraballo L. Demain J. Portnoy J. von Hertzen L. WAO Special Committee on Climate Change and BiodiversityThe biodiversity hypothesis and allergic disease: world allergy organization position statement.World Allergy Organ J. 2013; 6: 3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar], change in ambient temperatures, changes in weather during pollen seasons can cause both biological and chemical changes to pollens and have direct adverse consequences on human health by inducing disease exacerbations especially in urban and polluted regions. Appropriate environmental control measures of risk factors like indoor tobacco smoke, outdoor pollution and biomass fuel can have huge health benefits. There is also other complex but measurable associations between early life circumstances like maternal and childhood nutrition. Such evidences indicate early life opportunities for interventions targeted towards the prevention of allergies and asthma. Persons with allergic diseases like asthma also often have other comorbid conditions like diabetes, obesity, cardio-vascular disease, gastro esophageal diseases leading to more complex situations and worse outcomes associated with these complications. Furthermore, owing to the high health care costs, morbidity, impact on quality of like, absenteeism, poorer work performance and socio-economic costs, allergic diseases result in a socio-economic burden to the affected families as well as countries. The costs for treating rhinitis in the US have doubled in 5 years to 11 billion US$. In the developed countries, the financial burden of asthma ranges from US$ 300 to 1300 per patient per year annually. In developing countries, like Vietnam it is estimated to be US$184 per patient per year and in India, the monthly cost of medication for an asthmatic child can amount to one third of an average family’s monthly income. In the light of this ever-increasing threat of allergic diseases, high-, middle-, and low-income countries need to come together to develop a common strategy to find solutions at the levels of policy, health care delivery, health communication, and education under a platform of global cooperation. In fact, many developing countries are now caught in a stage of transition in which they face a growing burden of allergic diseases amongst other non-communicable diseases on top of the ongoing health problems of communicable diseases. Efforts targeting allergic diseases are still very fragmented. The WAO White Book on Allergy not only presents data on the growing epidemic of allergy worldwide, but also puts forward a set of recommendations the “Declaration of Recommendations ” targeted towards governments and health care policy makers, 1) need for epidemiological studies to assess the true burden of allergic diseases globally; 2) need to implement appropriate environmental control measures to reduce triggers and risk factors like smoking and outdoor pollutants and develop adequate preventative measures; 3) need to increase the availability of adequate trained personnel to diagnose and treat allergic diseases as well as make provisions for better availability and affordability of drugs; 4) need to bridge the knowledge gap in allergic diseases and asthma leading to increased capacity building; 5) need to increase the clinical expertise in treating allergic diseases and asthma; 6) need to make efforts to increase public awareness and work towards developing innovative preventative strategies. Global partnerships may encourage rapid and cost-effective scientific innovations. Large multicounty consortia are also needed to provide data from multiethnic populations for studies of genes and epigenetic phenomena, which could unravel the pathophysiological mechanisms behind some noncommunicable diseases; such consortia could also help to develop interventions that promote health globally. While the World Allergy Organization has been making constructive steps in various ways in the last years towards addressing this public health issue, a collaborative effort by the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI), the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI), the American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) and the World Allergy Organization (WAO) called International Collaboration in Asthma, Allergy and Immunology (iCAALL) has been working towards addressing allergic diseases through dissemination of knowledge and raising awareness at various levels. Globalization is creating an interdependence that affects both the risks of disease and their potential solutions. Global connections are much more apparent in the case of communicable infectious diseases, since viruses and bacteria are more readily perceived as cross-border threats; consequently, these diseases prompt global cooperation, as evidenced by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, among other initiatives. Although we must continue to address these threats, we must also increase the sense of urgency regarding noncommunicable diseases that are “communicated” by means of the global promotion of products and lifestyles, lest they insidiously undermine the health and wealth of nations. We have a great opportunity: global noncommunicable diseases can unite high-, middle-, and low-income countries in a common purpose, given their common causation, increasingly similar mortality rates and economic burdens worldwide, and generalizable preventive and curative solutions. The first challenge, however, will be to energize policymakers to recognize the need and that opportunity. Therefore efforts should be targeted towards a common goal of reducing the burden of allergic diseases, developing cost-effective innovative preventive strategies and a more integrated, holistic approach to treatment thereby preventing premature and unwanted deaths and improving the quality of life of patients.

10.1080/10409289.2017.1287993,Teacher Stress Predicts Child Executive Function: Moderation by School Poverty,,"Research Findings: Recent research has explored relations between classroom quality and child executive function (EF), but little is known about how teachers' well-being, including stress, relates to child EF—a crucial component of self-regulation. We hypothesized that teacher stress is negatively or curvilinearly related to child EF and classroom quality may be one mechanism explaining this relation. Furthermore, as working with young, low-income children may be particularly stressful, we tested the extent to which the relation between teacher stress and child EF varies by school-level poverty. Two-level hierarchical linear models using a sample of 171 kindergarten children and 33 teachers revealed a marginally significant linear relation between teacher stress and child EF (spring) controlling for baseline child EF (fall); there was no evidence for mediation by classroom quality. School-level poverty moderated the relation between teacher stress and child EF: Children attending low-poverty schools demonstrated smaller gains in EF when their teachers reported higher stress levels. However, in high-poverty schools high levels of teacher stress were not a risk factor for child EF. Practice or Policy: These novel findings are a first step to understanding how teachers' well-being relates to child EF across schools and have implications for supporting teachers.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Executive control,41

Cognitive and behavioral outcomes were collected pre-/posttest. Intent-to-treat mixed models tested group-time and group-time-attendance interactions. Effect sizes were calculated within and between groups.Feasibility was evidenced by 86% retention, 60% attendance, and average 75% maximum HR. Group-time results were null on the primary outcome, parent-reported executive function. Among secondary outcomes, between-group effect sizes favored exercise on hyperactive symptoms (d = 0.47) and verbal working memory (d = 0.26), and controls on visuospatial working memory (d = -0.21) and oppositional defiant symptoms (d = -0.37). In each group, within-group effect sizes were moderate to large on most outcomes (d = 0.67 to 1.60). A group-time-attendance interaction emerged on visuospatial working memory (F[1,33] = 7.42, P < 0.05), such that attendance to the control program was related to greater improvements (r = 0.72, P < 0.01), whereas attendance to the exercise program was not (r = 0.25, P = 0.34).Although between-group findings on the primary outcome, parent-reported executive function, were null, between-group effect sizes on hyperactivity and visuospatial working memory may reflect adaptations to the specific challenges presented by distinct formats. Both groups demonstrated substantial within-group improvements on clinically relevant outcomes. Findings underscore the importance of programmatic features, such as routines, engaging activities, behavior management strategies, and adult attention, and highlight the potential for after-school programs to benefit children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and disruptive behavior disorder living in urban poverty where health needs are high and services resources few.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Executive control,51
10.1017/s0020818300026448,Labor and hegemony,,"The United States' notice of withdrawal from the ILO is to be understood in terms of hegemonic power relations. “Tripartism” is an ideology based upon a dominant historical tendency, namely the emergence of a corporative form of state in both developed and underdeveloped countries. The AFL-CIO has participated in the construction of the corporative state in the US and has supported its hegemonic role in the world in concert with American business interests and the CIA. Neither the ILO nor international trade union organizations (especially the ICFTU) has enjoyed a stable relationship with the center of hegemonic power in the labor field, since the AFL-CIO has conducted a unilateral foreign policy. The functionalist strategy of executive leadership asserting the autonomy of an international organization through task expansion in technical fields has been almost totally irrelevant to the issue. Nor has the ILO found an alternative counter-hegemonic base of support, e.g., in the Third World. The existing hegemony has reasserted itself through the ILO program and ideology even as the US has withdrawn material support. Hegemony, which no longer operates through majority votes in international organizations, works instead through bureaucratic controls. This structure of power has prevented the ILO from confronting effectively the real social issues of employment-creation, land reform, marginality, and poverty in general. Initiatives that have been taken to deal with such issues have all ultimately been diverted into programs consistent with the hegemonic ideology and power relations.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Executive control,97

The present study provides a descriptive ‘snapshot’ of instability in low-income households, and examines the associations between exposure to major destabilizing events over the course of a year and three domains of poor urban children's self-regulation. Descriptive analyses suggest that although caregivers from unstable households report higher average levels of health problems and depression, they also have greater assets/savings, are more educated, and are less likely to be immigrants than caregivers from stable households. Results of propensity score-matched regression analyses reveal that high levels of household instability are significantly and negatively associated with preschoolers' effortful control and global attention/impulsivity control, but not with their executive function. Children from mildly unstable homes (i.e., those who had experienced a single destabilizing event in the past year) showed no significant differences in any domain of self-regulation relative to their peers from stable households, suggesting a dose-response relationship between the number of destabilizing events experienced by children and their outcomes.

To examine the developmental origins of civic engagement in a sample of U.S. children growing up in poverty, a conceptual model was tested employing the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class (ECLS-K) national data set. Using generalized linear models, we examined the contributions of kindergarten children's executive function and exposure to classroom based play to participation in different extracurricular activities in 8th grade. Results suggest that executive function is a significant predictor of participation in drama and music clubs, sports and number of hours spent in extracurricular activities. Play was also a significant predictor of participation in school clubs, while controlling for executive function.

10.1080/03003930600896293,Local democracy and the challenges of decentralising the state: An international perspective,,"Abstract Decentralisation has been a major element of governance reform in developed, developing and transitional countries over the past two decades. The driving forces have differed, as have the outcomes. This paper reviews a number of issues concerned with decentralisation, drawing comparisons between the experience in Central and Eastern Europe with that in a range of countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The analysis focuses in six key areas: the size of local government units and the need for an intermediate tier; structures for local democratic control; citizen participation and engagement of civil society; assignment of financial resources; central – local relations; and the impact of decentralisation on service delivery, poverty reduction and corruption. The conclusion is that decentralisation needs to be carefully designed and implemented if it is to achieve the desired outcomes. Notes 1 This article draws on findings from three recent research projects conducted by the International Development Department and funded by UK Department for International Development: Urban Governance, Partnerships and Poverty: A Study of Ten Cities in Asia, Africa and Latin America; Local Government Decision-Making, Citizen Participation and Accountability in Kenya and Uganda; and Building Municipal Capacity for Finance and Budgeting: Case Studies from India, Brazil, Kenya and Uganda. 2 Based on surveys in Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. 3 One exception is England, where the recent attempt to introduce an elected regional tier was defeated in a referendum. One of the main reasons was that the model of regional government being proposed was perceived as taking powers away from local government rather than decentralising (or making more accountable) central government functions. 4 A third model is that of central government appointment of the executive, as found in Ghana; this raises obvious issues about local accountability and responsiveness. 5 After 1989, local governments in several of these countries also received a share of nationally collected personal income tax. 6 Up till 1999, fewer than 5 per cent of local authorities in Kenya produced or submitted annual accounts, despite numerous exhortations from the Ministry of Local Government. Once this was introduced as a performance condition for the grant, the proportion increased to nearly 100 per cent. 7 This is not restricted to developing and transitional countries: there are many examples in the UK of local level manipulation of data in order to satisfy centrally prescribed targets. 8 It is common practice, for example, in many African countries for central governments to require central approval of local budgets. The main consideration is usually whether local budgets balance, since local governments are not allowed to incur deficits. Yet a common strategy for local governments is to inflate their revenue forecasts to match the planned expenditures. As a result, the approved budget is meaningless, since the budgeted revenues do not materialise, arbitrary cuts have to be made during the year, and the local government ends up with a deficit (Devas & Grant, Citation2003). 9 A recent conference on corruption highlighted some examples of civil society initiatives in Latin America to publicise information about municipal government decision-making about resource use, as a means of combating corruption (IV Global Forum on Combating Corruption, Brasília, June 2005, http://www.ivforumglobal.cgu.gov.br).",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Executive control,72

The socioeconomic literature successfully identified the major role of socioeconomic status of parents, both as a direct and indirect effect, in the shaping and intergenerational reproduction of wealth and health. Furthermore, the importance of cognitive abilities as actor in this process has been widely studied in socioeconomic literature. A third factor that has been identified by the socioeconomic discipline is the so-called non-cognitive capabilities. This category, however, lacks a clear definition and seems to be a catchall for a collection of factors. Within the repository of these non-cognitive capabilities the construct of executive functions is an interesting and important contribution from cognitive neuroscience. The multidimensional construct of executive functioning or cognitive control (i.e. planning and formulation of objectives) and monitoring processes (i.e. influences the execution of these goals) is a valuable addition to a framework on reproduction of wealth and health over generations, because executive functions are sensitive to training. Merging insights of the socioeconomic literature and cognitive neuroscience in a life cycle model opens the opportunity of educational initiatives with regard to executive functions to break the intergenerational reproduction of poverty and deprivation.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Executive control,23

While evidence linking childhood poverty and memory deficits in adulthood has been accumulating, underlying neural mechanisms are unknown. To investigate neurobiological links between childhood poverty and adult memory performance, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a visuospatial memory task in healthy young adults with varying income levels during childhood. Participants were assessed at age 9 and followed through young adulthood to assess income and related factors. During adulthood, participants completed a visuospatial memory task while undergoing MRI scanning. Patterns of neural activation, as well as memory recognition for items, were assessed to examine links between brain function and memory performance as it relates to childhood income. Our findings revealed associations between item recognition, childhood income level, and hippocampal activation. Specifically, the association between hippocampal activation and recognition accuracy varied as a function of childhood poverty, with positive associations at higher income levels, and negative associations at lower income levels.

Verbal and visuospatial working memory tasks were administered to sixth-grade students living in low-income rural, low-income urban, high-income rural, and high-income urban developmental contexts. Both low-income rural and low-income urban children showed working memory deficits compared with their high-income counterparts, but their deficits were distinct. Low-income urban children exhibited symmetrical verbal and visuospatial working memory deficits compared with their high-income urban counterparts. Meanwhile, low-income rural children exhibited asymmetrical deficits when compared with their high-income rural counterparts, with more extreme visuospatial working memory deficits than verbal working memory deficits. These results suggest that different types of poverty are associated with different working memory abilities.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Memory,43

Functional neuroimaging and lesion studies suggest that prefrontal hypoactivity may underlie both. The purpose of the present study was to further characterise this association in terms of functional lateralisation. A more pronounced association between psychomotor poverty and verbal memory deficits would suggest more left prefrontal overlap than right, and vice-versa for a more pronounced association with nonverbal memory deficits.A total of 68 inpatients (48 males, 20 females) diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder participated in this study. We evaluated the correlation between verbal and nonverbal memory performance (assessed using the RAVLT and BVMT, respectively) and psychomotor poverty (assessed using the SSPI).A trend towards a more pronounced association for nonverbal compared to verbal material was not upheld by conservative statistical testing.Bilateral prefrontal overlap between psychomotor poverty and episodic memory is the most conservative interpretation of these data.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Memory,18

This article not only explores how memory can be brought into the discourse of post-disaster resilience but also critiques the very language of resilience and well-being as part of an ideological cluster with problematic implications. Resilience is a peculiarly modern form of theodicy, an explanation of misery and suffering that seeks to make sense of these fundamental, but ultimately inexplicable, human experiences. To demonstrate the limits of therapeutic discourse, the article explores Jean Amèry’s account of resentment as well as Emmanuel Levinas’ concept of “useless suffering.” Placing these concepts in the longer discourse about theodicy, the article argues for a wary contextualization of the discourse on resilience, which risks exacerbating exactly that which it seeks to aid.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Memory,13

Poverty is a type of pervasive experience that is likely to influence biobehavioral processes because children developing in such environments often encounter high levels of stress and reduced environmental stimulation. This study explores the association between socioeconomic status and the hippocampus, a brain region involved in learning and memory that is known to be affected by stress. We employ a voxel-based morphometry analytic framework with region of interest drawing for structural brain images acquired from participants across the socioeconomic spectrum (n = 317). Children from lower income backgrounds had lower hippocampal gray matter density, a measure of volume. This finding is discussed in terms of disparities in education and health that are observed across the socioeconomic spectrum.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Memory,340
10.1093/gerona/glv013,Polypharmacy Among Adults Aged 65 Years and Older in the United States: 1988–2010,,"Older adults frequently have several chronic health conditions which require multiple medications. We illustrated trends in prescription medication use over 20 years in the United States, and described characteristics of older adults using multiple medications in 2009–2010. Participants included 13,869 adults aged 65 years and older in the National Health & Nutrition Examination Survey (1988–2010). Prescription medication use was verified by medication containers. Potentially inappropriate medications were defined by the 2003 Beers Criteria. Between 1988 and 2010 the median number of prescription medications used among adults aged 65 and older doubled from 2 to 4, and the proportion taking ≥5 medications tripled from 12.8% (95% confidence interval: 11.1, 14.8) to 39.0% (35.8, 42.3).These increases were driven, in part, by rising use of cardioprotective and antidepressant medications. Use of potentially inappropriate medications decreased from 28.2% (25.5, 31.0) to 15.1% (13.2, 17.3) between 1988 and 2010. Higher medication use was associated with higher prevalence of functional limitation, activities of daily living limitation, and confusion/memory problems in 2009–2010, although these associations did not remain after adjustment for covariates. In multivariable models, older age, number of chronic conditions, and annual health care visits were associated with increased odds of using both 1–4 and ≥5 medications. Additionally, body mass index, higher income-poverty ratio, former smoking, and non-black non-white race were associated with use of ≥5 medications. Prescription medication use increased dramatically among older adults between 1988 and 2010. Contemporary older adults on multiple medications have worse health status compared with those on less medications, and appear to be a vulnerable population.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Memory,505

10.1080/13621020601099856,Inclusive Citizenship: Realizing the Potential1,,"Abstract Citizenship has been described as a ""momentum concept"". One important development over the past decade has been the various ways in which scholars and activists have developed citizenship's inclusionary potential. The first part of the article explores these developments in general terms with regard to the values underpinning inclusive citizenship; the implications of the notion of cultural citizenship; and the theorization of differentiated forms of citizenship, which nevertheless appeal to universalist principles. These principles provide the basis for the citizenship claims of people living in poverty, a group largely ignored in citizenship studies. Other lacunae have been disability and, until recently, childhood. The second part of the article discusses how citizenship studies has reworked the concept in a more inclusionary direction through the development of a multi-tiered analysis, which pays attention to the spaces and places in which lived citizenship is practised. It focuses in particular on the intimate and domestic sphere, with particular reference to debates around care and citizenship, and on the interconnections between the intimate/domestic and the global, using ""global care chains"" and ecological citizenship as examples. Notes 1 This article is dedicated to the memory of Iris Marion Young (1949–2006) whose work did so much to challenge exclusionary expressions of citizenship and to contribute to more differentiated, inclusive forms. 2 The case studies in the South (in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru and South Africa) were part of an international research partnership—the Development Research Centre on Citizenship, Participation and Accountability—based at the Institute of Development Studies in the UK (www.drc.citizenship.org). 3 Angharade E. Beckett, however, notes that not all disabled people want to be seen as different and that analysis of the UK disability movement raises the possibility that some ""individuals may be inaccurately labelled as 'different' not only by dominant 'outsiders' but also by dominant voices internal to the group"" (2005, p. 417, emphasis in original). 4 An edited collection on Children and Citizenship, edited by Clutton, Invernizzi and Williams, is also due to be published by Sage in 2007 or 2008. 5 An embodied understanding also emerges from the work of disability theorists. 6 With regard to adults, some disabled feminists have also challenged the very language of care as undermining disabled people's autonomy and hence their citizenship (see, for instance, Morris, Citation2005). 7 This issue is explored in more depth in Lister (Citation2007b).",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Memory,603

The sites constituting the LWH articulate a public memory of FDR where Warm Springs is central to understanding the president's character and accomplishments.

10.1068/p241075,Is the Richness of Our Visual World an Illusion? Transsaccadic Memory for Complex Scenes,,"Our construction of a stable visual world, despite the presence of saccades, is discussed. A computer-graphics method was used to explore transsaccadic memory for complex images. Images of real-life scenes were presented under four conditions: they stayed still or moved in an unpredictable direction (forcing an eye movement), while simultaneously changing or staying the same. Changes were the appearance, disappearance, or rotation of an object in the scene. Subjects detected the changes easily when the image did not move but when it moved their performance fell to chance. A grey-out period was introduced to mimic that which occurs during a saccade. This also reduced performance but not to chance levels. These results reveal the poverty of transsaccadic memory for real-life complex scenes. They are discussed with respect to Dennett's view that much less information is available in vision than our subjective impression leads us to believe. Our stable visual world may be constructed out of a brief retinal image and a very sketchy, higher-level representation along with a pop-out mechanism to redirect attention. The richness of our visual world is, to this extent, an illusion.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Memory,192
10.1177/0963721416655100,The Benefits of Reminiscing With Young Children,,"Parents talk about the past with their young children from the time their children can talk. There is robust evidence that when parents discuss the past in a detailed, emotional, and collaborative way (elaborative reminiscing), their children have stronger autobiographical memory skills. We review recent research showing that elaborative reminiscing also has significant benefits for children’s language and socioemotional skills. Importantly, these findings show that elaborative reminiscing is effective with children at risk of compromised development in the context of poverty, maltreatment, or psychopathology. Elaborative reminiscing appears to foster development by providing children with practice using challenging language, encouraging them to put their experiences into words, and optimizing memory for the information gained during conversations. Although further research in diverse cultures is required, reminiscing is a promising tool—available to all families—for promoting children’s cognitive and socioemotional development.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Memory,166
10.1080/17441691003796387,Structural barriers to ART adherence in Southern Africa: Challenges and potential ways forward,,"Abstract Abstract Structural barriers to antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence are economic, institutional, political and cultural factors, that collectively influence the extent to which persons living with HIV follow their medication regimens. We identify three sets of structural barriers to ART adherence that are salient in Southern Africa: poverty-related, institutional, and political and cultural. Examples of poverty-related barriers are competing demands in the context of resource-constrained settings, the lack of transport infrastructure, food insecurity, the role of disability grants and poor social support. Examples of institutional factors are logistical barriers, overburdened health care facilities, limited access to mental health services and difficulties in ensuring adequate counselling. Examples of political and cultural barriers are controversies in the provision of treatment for AIDS, migration, traditional beliefs about HIV and AIDS, poor health literacy and gender inequalities. In forging a way forward, we identify ways in which individuals, communities and health care systems may overcome some of these structural barriers. Finally, we make recommendations for further research on structural barriers to ART adherence. In all likelihood, enhancing adherence to ART requires the efforts of a variety of disciplines, including public health, psychology, anthropology, sociology and medicine.

10.1177/0003122413486800,The Corner and the Crew: The Influence of Geography and Social Networks on Gang Violence,,"Nearly a century of empirical research examines how neighborhood properties influence a host of phenomena such as crime, poverty, health, civic engagement, immigration, and economic inequality. Theoretically bundled within these neighborhood effects are institutions’ and actors’ social networks that are the foundation of other neighborhood-level processes such as social control, mobilization, and cultural assimilation. Yet, despite such long-standing theoretical links between neighborhoods and social networks, empirical research rarely considers or measures dimensions of geography and social network mechanisms simultaneously. The present study seeks to fill this gap by analyzing how both geography and social networks influence an important social problem in urban America: gang violence. Using detailed data on fatal and non-fatal shootings, we examine effects of geographic proximity, organizational memory, and additional group processes (e.g., reciprocity, transitivity, and status seeking) on gang violence in Chicago and Boston. Results show adjacency of gang turf and prior conflict between gangs are strong predictors of subsequent gang violence. Furthermore, important network processes, including reciprocity and status seeking, also contribute to observed patterns of gang violence. In fact, we find that these spatial and network processes mediate racial effects, suggesting the primacy of place and the group in generating gang violence.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Memory,397

Relatively few studies, however, have directly compared symptoms and neurocognitive test performance as predictors of psychosocial status in a prospective design. In two studies with schizophrenia patients, we investigated the relationship between symptom dimensions (psychomotor poverty, disorganization, reality distortion) and neurocognitive measures (problem solving, attention, verbal learning and memory) obtained at study entry, and psychosocial status measured at a 1- and 4-year followup. Results from the 1-year followup (n = 70) revealed that psychomotor poverty, symptoms of disorganization, and performance on measures of card-sorting and visual vigilance were related to psychosocial status. Results from the 4-year followup (n = 26) revealed a similar pattern of findings with the exception of verbal learning, which emerged as a predictor of psychosocial status only at the 4-year followup. Stepwise regression revealed that performance on measures of visual vigilance and psychomotor poverty symptoms explained the largest amount of variance in psychosocial status at both followup intervals. The significance of these findings for the development and assessment of novel treatment interventions for schizophrenia is discussed.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Memory,120

Thus, CM can disrupt neuropsychological integration during critical developmental periods, impacting on global neurological integrity, attentional vigilance, perceptual acuity, and subsequent development of visual-spatial processing and memory foundational to global cognitive ability. A subsequent structural equation model confirmed that rural children are at greater risk for CM, subsequent attention deficits, and other developmental risk factors in addition to the CM impact on K-ABC performance. We document CM as one of a host of developmental risk factors within the complex web of poverty in sub-Saharan Africa, which limit children's ability to achieve their full intellectual potential and, thus, extend the human cost of the disease beyond general measures of mortality and morbidity.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Memory,168

Two approaches to definition were compared: an experimental approach (using story-retelling, rote-memory ability, and invented-morpheme learning) and a traditional approach (using standardized-test discrepancy scores). Results indicated that 6 of 34 children tracked from kindergarten through second grade appeared to be SLI at the end of the study. The best kindergarten predictor for the outcome status of these 6 children was a combination of the score on the Oral Vocabulary subtest of the TOLD-2P and the score on a combination of the experimental tasks. The best single kindergarten predictor of the academic status of the 15 children in the study who received academic remediation was story-retelling.

The study is based on a longitudinal cohort of children in rural Ecuador (n = 2118).The schooling and vocabulary levels of mothers were strong predictors of the cognitive development of young children. Household wealth and child's height, weight, and hemoglobin levels explained only a modest fraction of the observed associations. The vocabulary levels of mothers and children were more strongly correlated among older children in the sample, suggesting that the effects of a richer maternal vocabulary are cumulative.Differences in children's cognitive outcomes start very early, which has important implications for the intergenerational transmission of poverty and inequality.

It aims, primarily, to understand why family planning became such an important point of state intervention during the Emergency, when millions were sterilized. I argue that family planning was intended as a technocratic fix for the problem of poverty and that, although the family planning program existed before the Emergency, it received a fillip through Indira Gandhi's Emergency-era push for poverty eradication thanks to the established position of population control as a prerequisite for economic development. Secondly, it aims to understand how the Emergency and sterilization have become conflated in popular memory, such that the driving forces of poverty eradication and economic development have dropped out of the story altogether.

Spatial working memory was measured using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery Spatial Working Memory task. Greenspace was measured as the percentage of greenery in the child's ward.Even after controlling for confounders, lower quantity of neighbourhood greenspace was related to poorer spatial working memory. Importantly, neighbourhood deprivation did not modify this relationship. Therefore, lower quantity of greenspace was related to poorer spatial working memory similarly in deprived and non-deprived neighbourhoods.Children living in greener urban neighbourhoods have better spatial working memory. If this association is causal, then our findings can be used to inform policy decisions about both education and urban planning.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and working memory,59
10.3389/fpubh.2024.1341501,"Association between poverty, low educational level and smoking with adolescent’s working memory: cross lagged analysis from longitudinal data",,"Background Working memory is a crucial element of cognitive function. Previous cross-sectional studies have identified various determinants of working memory in children and adolescents. Nonetheless, no study has yet demonstrated the causal relationship of social determinants with working memory in adolescents. Objective This study explores the causal link between the level of education, smoking, and other factors with adolescent’s working memory. Methods This study analyzed secondary data from waves 4 and 5 of the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), utilizing cross-lagged analysis in Jamovi version 2.4.8. The variables included working memory score, maternal education, household income, stress, educational level, smoking, urbanicity, and physical activity. These variables were extracted from IFLS waves 4 and 5, and each dependent variable in IFLS wave four was controlled by the same dependent variables in IFLS 5. Then, we used cross-lagged analysis to assess the causality between each dependent variable and a working memory score in IFLS wave 5. Result The findings indicate that level of education had a positive impact on working memory in adolescents aged 15–18 years, with a Beta value of 0.18 (95% CI 0.81–0.2; p &amp;lt; 0.001). Smoking and age were negatively associated with working memory, with Beta values of −0.07 (95% CI -0.65 -0.04; p &amp;lt; 0.029) and − 0.10 (95% CI -0.25 -0.05; p &amp;lt; 0.003), respectively. No evidence was found for a significant correlation between poverty and adolescents’s working memory. Conclusion The findings indicate that increased education levels are associated with improved working memory in adolescents aged 15–18. At the same time, smoking has a negative impact on working memory in this age group.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and working memory,1
10.1111/desc.12822,Early adversity in rural India impacts the brain networks underlying visual working memory,,"Abstract There is a growing need to understand the global impact of poverty on early brain and behavioural development, particularly with regard to key cognitive processes that emerge in early development. Although the impact of adversity on brain development can trap children in an intergenerational cycle of poverty, the massive potential for brain plasticity is also a source of hope: reliable, accessible, culturally agnostic methods to assess early brain development in low resource settings might be used to measure the impact of early adversity, identify infants for timely intervention and guide the development and monitor the effectiveness of early interventions. Visual working memory (VWM) is an early marker of cognitive capacity that has been assessed reliably in early infancy and is predictive of later academic achievement in Western countries. Here, we localized the functional brain networks that underlie VWM in early development in rural India using a portable neuroimaging system, and we assessed the impact of adversity on these brain networks. We recorded functional brain activity as young children aged 4–48 months performed a VWM task. Brain imaging results revealed localized activation in the frontal cortex, replicating findings from a Midwestern US sample. Critically, children from families with low maternal education and income showed weaker brain activity and poorer distractor suppression in canonical working memory areas in the left frontal cortex. Implications of this work are far‐reaching: it is now cost‐effective to localize functional brain networks in early development in low‐resource settings, paving the way for novel intervention and assessment methods.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and working memory,69

Measures of environmental unpredictability, violence, and poverty were collected to test adversity × task version interactions. There were no interactions for attention shifting. For working memory updating, youth exposed to violence and poverty scored lower than their peers with abstract stimuli but almost just as well with ecological stimuli.

Traumatizing experiences cumulatively heighten the risk for trauma-related disorders, and with it affect cognitive and psycho-social functioning.Objectives: We aimed at investigating the association between trauma-related disorders and cognitive and psycho-social functioning and hypothesized that PTSD symptom severity would negatively correlate with executive functioning, working memory and psycho-social functioning in everyday life.Method: In total, 323 Congolese refugees (mean age: 31.3 years) who arrived in the Ugandan Nakivale refugee settlement after January 2012 were assessed regarding their exposure to traumatic events, PTSD symptom severity (posttraumatic symptom scale interview), executive functioning (Tower of London), working memory performance (Corsi block tapping task) and psycho-social dysfunctioning (Luo functioning scale).Results: Hierarchical regression analyses indicated a significant negative association between PTSD symptom severity and working memory (β = –0.32, p < 0.001), as well as executive functions (β = –0.19, p = 0.003). Furthermore, the impairment of psycho-social functioning in everyday life was positively related with PTSD symptom severity (β = 0.70, p < 0.001), and negatively with executive functioning (β = –0.15, p = 0.003). However, working memory performance was not significantly related to psycho-social dysfunctioning (β = 0.09, p > 0.05).Conclusion: Trauma survivors not only suffer from the core PTSD symptoms but also from impaired cognitive functioning. PTSD symptom severity seems furthermore to be related to impaired psycho-social functioning. Our findings suggest that trauma-related mental health problems may heighten the risk for poverty and lack of prospect and further aggravate the consequences of war and conflict.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and working memory,51
10.1017/s0033291703001569,Relationship of behavioural and symptomatic syndromes in schizophrenia to spatial working memory and attentional set-shifting ability,,"Background. Behavioural syndromes (thought disturbance, social withdrawal, depressed behaviour and antisocial behaviour) offer a different perspective from that of symptomatic syndromes on the disability that may be associated with schizophrenia. Few studies have assessed their relationship with neuropsychological deficits. We hypothesized that these syndromes may represent behavioural manifestations of frontal-subcortical impairments, previously described in schizophrenia. Method. Long-stay inpatients ( n =54) and community patients ( n =43) with enduring schizophrenia were assessed, using measures of symptoms and behaviour and tests of executive functioning. The relationship between syndromes and neuropsychological function was assessed using multiple regression and logistic regression analyses. Results. Significant associations were found between performance on the spatial working memory task and the psychomotor poverty symptomatic syndrome, and between attentional set-shifting ability and both disorganization symptoms and the thought disturbance behavioural syndrome. These results were not explained by the effect of premorbid IQ, geographical location, length of illness or antipsychotic medication. Length of illness was an independent predictor of attentional set-shifting ability but not of working memory performance. Conclusion. The specific relationship between negative symptoms and spatial working memory is consistent with involvement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The associations between difficulty with set-shifting ability and both disorganization symptoms and behaviours may reflect inability to generalize a rule that had been learned and impaired ability to respond flexibly. The specific relationship of illness duration to set-shifting ability may suggest progressive impairment on some executive tasks. The nature of these relationships and their neurobiological and rehabilitation implications are considered.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and working memory,64
10.1016/j.dcn.2019.100642,Socioeconomic hardship and delayed reward discounting: Associations with working memory and emotional reactivity,,"Prolonged exposure to socioeconomic hardship (SH) is associated with greater delayed reward discounting (DRD), a form of impulsive decision-making that reflects a reduced capacity to delay gratification and a significant correlate of diverse risk behaviors, but the neurobehavioral mechanisms linking SH and DRD are unknown. An emerging hypothesis suggests that cognitive and affective stress associated with poverty may tax neurocognitive functions, such as working memory (WM), and lead to impulsive DRD. Furthermore, research suggests that emotional reactivity (ER) is an important dispositional factor to consider in the link between executive functions and DRD. Thus, we longitudinally examined the indirect effect of SH on impulsive DRD via a network of brain regions associated with WM function in a sample of young adults, and whether that link was moderated by ER. Participants were 119 rural African Americans (aged 19-24 years) assessed behaviorally on four occasions, with fMRI at the last time point. Results showed that, among emerging adults with higher ER, SH severity was predictive of increased DRD via reduced response in brain regions activated during an n-back WM task. These findings reveal both the cognitive and affective mechanisms that underlie the relationship between SH and DRD.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and working memory,66

10.1201/9780203508596-33,Visuocognitive Dysfunctions in Parkinson’s Disease,,"Loss of will, decreased activity, and poverty of behavior are among the common symptoms observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). In line with these clinical observations, PD patients display prominent deficit in neuropsychological tests, requiring self-generated and effort-demanding operations. However, recent evidence suggests that this impairment is not generalized: visuo-spatial working memory and attentional set-shifting seem to be selectively impaired in the early stages of the disease. Electrophysiological studies also demonstrate the dysfunction of higher-level visual information processing. In this article, we discuss some current results to show the connection between clinical symptoms and neuropsychological deficits. We also consider dysfunction in underlying neural mechanisms, with particular emphasis on the dysregulation of fronto-striatal circuits. However, it is conceivable that visuo-cognitive impairment in PD reflects dysfunction of neural assemblies, involving basal ganglia, dorsal visual stream, and frontal-prefrontal circuits.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and working memory,44

In an effort to understand the impact that the physical learning environment, such as noise or large class sizes, have on learning in South African foundation phase classrooms, this study deployed a qualitative case study design to gain insight into the learning and teaching that take place in Grade 1 classrooms. From a cognitive load perspective, the study found that noise, as result of the large number of learners in the class, as well as noise from the outdoor environment, contributes to the overload of learners’ working memory, which ultimately impacts negatively on learning. The study also found that the large classroom sizes in Grade 1 prevented teachers from rendering effective support, which causes uncertainty among learners in regard to what is expected of them when working on classroom tasks. This uncertainty leads to extraneous cognitive load.Keywords: education; extraneous cognitive load; foundation phase; mathematics; physical learning environment; poverty eradication; South Africa; sustainable development; working memory",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and working memory,26

10.2307/1955040,On Political Theory and Political Action,,"This paper is a revision of the Presidential Address delivered to the 66th Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, Los Angeles, California, September 10, 1970. It identifies nine aspects of political theories: storage and retrieval of memories; assistance to insight; simplification of knowledge; heuristic effectiveness; self-critical cognition; normative awareness of values; scientifically testable knowledge; pragmatic skills; and wisdom, or second-order knowledge of what contexts are worth choosing—a wisdom subject to the possibility of radical restructuring. These nine aspects of theory form an integrated production cycle of knowledge. “Scientific” and “humanistic” political theorists need each other to understand the central task of politics: the collective self-determination of societies. To appraise this steering performance of political systems, large amounts of empirical data as indicators of social performance are indispensable. Political science has grown in knowledge of cases, data, research methods, and sensitivity to problems of disadvantaged groups and of the individual. It is learning to recognize qualities and patterns, verify the limited truth content of theories, and be more critical of its societies and of itself. It needs to increase research on implementation of insights, on positive proposals for reform, changes in political wisdom, and on the abolition of poverty and large-scale war. For these tasks, cognitive contributions from political theory are indispensable; working to make them remains a moral commitment.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and working memory,30

Eleven tests measured cognitive function. Interactions among diabetes, race, and poverty status with cognition were assessed in multiple regression analyses.Significant interactions among diabetes, race, and poverty status were observed. Among African Americans below poverty, diabetic individuals performed lower than nondiabetic individuals on California Verbal Learning Test Free Recall Short Delay (z = -0.444 [0.123] versus z = -0.137 [0.045]) and Long Delay (z = -0.299 [0.123] versus z = -0.130 [0.045]), Digit Span Backward (z = -0.347 [0.109] versus z = -0.072 [0.041]), and the Brief Test of Attention (z = -0.452 [-0.099] versus z = -0.099 [0.047]), and higher on Category Fluency (z = 0.114 [0.117] versus z = -0.118 [0.044]). No consistent differences between diabetic and nondiabetic individuals were found for African American and white participants above poverty.Diabetes was associated with poorer verbal memory, working memory, and attention among African Americans living in poverty. Diabetic African Americans below poverty may have increased risk of cognitive deficit at a younger age. Improving health literacy, doctor-patient communication, and multidisciplinary medical care for impoverished individuals may reduce differences.

The effects of sleep on cognition are not uniform and thus we tested race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and sex as moderators of these associations. At the first assessment, 282 children aged 9.44 years (52% boys, 65% European American [EA], 35% African American [AA]) participated. Two more waves of data collection spaced 1 year apart followed. The majority of children (63%) were living at or below the poverty line. Children's sleep was measured objectively with actigraphy and 2 well-established sleep parameters were derived: duration, indexed by sleep minutes between sleep onset and wake time, and quality, indexed by efficiency. Multiple cognitive functioning domains were examined with the Woodcock Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities (WJ III). Across the sample, higher sleep efficiency, but not duration, was associated with better cognitive performance. Significant moderation effects emerged. Controlling for SES, AA children scored lower on general intellectual ability and working memory (WM) at age 11 only if they experienced lower sleep efficiency at age 9. Further, boys scored lower on general abilities and processing speed (PS) at age 11 only if their sleep efficiency was lower at age 9. Findings indicate that lower sleep efficiency may contribute to lower cognitive functioning especially for AA children and boys. These vulnerabilities appear to emerge early in development and are maintained over time. Results underscore the importance of individual differences in explicating relations between sleep and children's cognitive performance.

However, in the Asian setting, with its prevailing poverty, information about the influence of SES on cognitive development of female adolescents is limited. This study was aimed to investigate the association between SES and neurocognitive performance of early female adolescents in Sri Lanka. Methods Female adolescents aged 11–14 years (n = 200) of low and middle SES were studied to assess neurocognitive function. After obtaining baseline data, eight subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC – IV), Test Of Nonverbal Intelligence (TONI-3) and two computer-based executive function tests (inhibition and visuo-spatial working memory) were administered to assess neurocognitive measures of the above adolescents. The results were compiled into a data base and analyzed using SPSS version 20 statistical software. Results Higher SES was associated with higher performance in all neurocognitive tests. Low SES adolescents obtained significantly poor test scores for executive function test (inhibitory control: p &lt; 0.0001) and for WISC [verbal comprehension index (VCI): p &lt; 0.0001), working memory index (WMI): p &lt; 0.0001 and estimated full scale IQ (EFSIQ): p &lt; 0.0001)] when compared with middle SES adolescents.

Like street artists and neighborhood assemblies working in a variety of genres, stencil-makers compose public evidence of powerful trans-boundary imaginaries that are at the same time part of a uniquely Argentinean cultural formation. This analysis is based on over 300 digital photographic examples collected by the author in 2007 post-crisis Argentina, where the flourishing of artistic dissent is shaped by vibrant immigrant traditions, widespread poverty, and the recent political history of military dictatorship followed by an economic collapse that radicalized youth and the middle class. Building on Gell's argument that art objects, and the places that form part of their causal milieu, share social agency with the artists that produce them, this article shows how stencils confront institutional power by expanding the semiotic range of two aquatic spaces: a neighborhood fountain in Buenos Aires and a national riverfront monument in Rosario.

Using data from the 2001-2004 National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement, a cross-sectional US population study of adolescents aged 13-18 years (n = 10,073), we examined the associations between 11 childhood adversities and intelligence, using targeted maximum likelihood estimation. Targeted maximum likelihood estimation incorporates machine learning to identify the relationships between exposures and outcomes without overfitting, including interactions and nonlinearity. The nonverbal score from the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test was used as a standardized measure of fluid reasoning. Childhood adversities were grouped into deprivation and threat types based on recent conceptual models. Adjusted marginal mean differences compared the mean intelligence score if all adolescents experienced each adversity to the mean in the absence of the adversity. The largest associations were observed for deprivation-type experiences, including poverty and low parental education, which were related to reduced intelligence. Although lower in magnitude, threat events related to intelligence included physical abuse and witnessing domestic violence.

To this, we add six research challenges: to relate the infrastructure of smart cities to their operational functioning and planning through management, control and optimisation; to explore the notion of the city as a laboratory for innovation; to provide portfolios of urban simulation which inform future designs; to develop technologies that ensure equity, fairness and realise a better quality of city life; to develop technologies that ensure informed participation and create shared knowledge for democratic city governance; and to ensure greater and more effective mobility and access to opportunities for urban populations. We begin by defining the state of the art, explaining the science of smart cities. We define six scenarios based on new cities badging themselves as smart, older cities regenerating themselves as smart, the development of science parks, tech cities, and technopoles focused on high technologies, the development of urban services using contemporary ICT, the use of ICT to develop new urban intelligence functions, and the development of online and mobile forms of participation.

While the vast majority of low birth weight children have normal outcomes, as a group they generally have higher rates of subnormal growth, illnesses, and neurodevelopmental problems. These problems increase as the child's birth weight decreases. With the exception of a small minority of low birth weight children with mental retardation and/or cerebral palsy, the developmental sequelae for most low birth weight infants include mild problems in cognition, attention, and neuromotor functioning. Long-term follow-up studies conducted on children born in the 1960s indicated that the adverse consequences of being born low birth weight were still apparent in adolescence. Adverse sociodemographic factors negatively affect developmental outcomes across the continuum of low birth weight and appear to have far greater effects on long-term cognitive outcomes than most of the biological risk factors. In addition, the cognitive defects associated with social or environmental risks become more pronounced as the child ages. Enrichment programs for low birth weight children seem to be most effective for the moderately low birth weight child who comes from a lower socioeconomic group. Continued research and attempts to decrease the rate of low birth weight and associated perinatal medical sequelae are of primary importance. Ongoing documentation of the long-term outcome of low birth weight children needs to be mandated, as does the implementation of environmental enrichment programs to help ameliorate the long-term consequences for infants who are born low birth weight.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Fluid intelligence,708

10.1097/dbp.0000000000001210,Association Between Neighborhood Deprivation and Child Cognition in Clinically Referred Youth,,"Abstract: Objective: When socioeconomic status is measured at the individual and/or family level, it has long been associated with cognition in children. However, the association between neighborhood deprivation, an index of community-level socioeconomic status, and child cognition is not fully understood. The goal of this study was to investigate (1) the relationship between neighborhood deprivation and child cognitive functioning and (2) whether child age moderates the relationship between cognitive functioning and neighborhood deprivation. Methods: This study included 9878 children, ages 3 through 17 years (M = 10.4 yrs, SD = 3.4 yrs). Data were gathered from children referred for and evaluated at an urban, outpatient neuropsychology assessment clinic between 2006 and 2022, located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Neighborhood socioeconomic status was measured at the census block level using the Area Deprivation Index composite. Results: There was a 20-point median difference in overall intelligence between the neighborhoods with the lowest and highest levels of deprivation. Overall intelligence and verbal comprehension, compared with working memory, fluid reasoning, and processing speed, demonstrated the strongest negative association with neighborhood deprivation (all p &lt; 0.05). Older children had lower overall intelligence scores compared with younger children in neighborhoods with high levels of deprivation ( p &lt; 0.01), suggesting a cumulative influence of poverty exposure. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the stark disparities in child cognitive functioning across levels of neighborhood deprivation. Findings support the importance of access to early interventions and services that promote intellectual growth and verbal capacity among children who live in neighborhoods with great deprivation.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Fluid intelligence,5

This article emphasises the important role of paediatricians in the implementation of health policies devised to promote breast‐feeding. The European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition Committee on Nutrition recognises breast‐feeding as the natural and advisable way of supporting the healthy growth and development of young children. This article delineates the health benefits of breast‐feeding, reduced risk of infectious diarrhoea and acute otitis media being the best documented. Exclusive breast‐feeding for around 6 months is a desirable goal, but partial breast‐feeding as well as breast‐feeding for shorter periods of time are also valuable. Continuation of breast‐feeding after the introduction of complementary feeding is encouraged as long as mutually desired by mother and child. The role of health care workers, including paediatricians, is to protect, promote, and support breast‐feeding. Health care workers should be trained in breast‐feeding issues and counselling, and they should encourage practices that do not undermine breast‐feeding. Societal standards and legal regulations that facilitate breast‐feeding should be promoted, such as providing maternity leave for at least 6 months and protecting working mothers.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Fluid intelligence,673

The present research identifies which forms of cognitive capacity are related to health event recall and assesses the roles of poverty and illiteracy as mediating variables.

Concurrently, the mission of protected areas has expanded from biodiversity conservation to improving human welfare. The result is a shift in favor of protected areas allowing local resource use. Given the multiple purposes of many protected areas, measuring effectiveness is difficult. Our review of 49 tropical protected areas shows that parks are generally effective at curtailing deforestation within their boundaries. But deforestation in surrounding areas is isolating protected areas. Many initiatives now aim to link protected areas to local socioeconomic development. Some of these initiatives have been successful, but in general expectations need to be tempered regarding the capacity of protected areas to alleviate poverty. Greater attention must also be paid to the broader policy context of biodiversity loss, poverty, and unsustainable land use in developing countries.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Attention,1108

It is a condition that can have adverse health, social and educational outcomes. It also exacts significant societal costs, economically and socially. This paper hypothesises that the population of children receiving a clinical diagnosis of ADHD is aetiologically heterogeneous: that within this population, there is a group for whom the development of ADHD is largely genetically driven, and another who have a ‘phenocopy’ of ADHD as a result of very adverse early childhood experiences, with the prevalence of this phenocopy being heavily skewed towards populations living with poverty and violence. A third group will have a high genetic risk and have been exposed to violence. These groups will overlap, with epigenetic phenomena and other environmental factors, for example, preterm birth, poor intrauterine growth, foetal exposure to teratogens, playing an important role for all affected children in determining the severity of their functional difficulties.

### Phenocopies

Phenocopies occur when people exhibit a phenotype that appears identical to that found in other individuals who have a linked genotype, but do not possess this genotype themselves. Environmental factors may cause this, as occurs in Rutter's autism phenocopy described in Romanian orphans adopted by western families in the early 1990s.1 These children had experienced extreme, profound neglect; after adoption, they began to present to services with abnormal or delayed development. Many presented a clinical and behavioural picture indistinguishable from autism in preschool children. However, follow-up revealed a different natural history to that of childhood autism, with these children no longer fulfilling criteria for autism, with mild cognitive impairment, low empathy and conduct problems prevailing in adolescence.2 Animal models suggest a possible epigenetic mechanism for this, with environments of profound neglect associated with alterations in gene expression as a result of …",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Attention,35

10.1353/jod.1995.0002,Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital,,"Bowling Alone: America’s Declining Social Capital Robert D. Putnam (bio) Many students of the new democracies that have emerged over the past decade and a half have emphasized the importance of a strong and active civil society to the consolidation of democracy. Especially with regard to the postcommunist countries, scholars and democratic activists alike have lamented the absence or obliteration of traditions of independent civic engagement and a widespread tendency toward passive reliance on the state. To those concerned with the weakness of civil societies in the developing or postcommunist world, the advanced Western democracies and above all the United States have typically been taken as models to be emulated. There is striking evidence, however, that the vibrancy of American civil society has notably declined over the past several decades. Ever since the publication of Alexis de Tocqueville’s Democracy in America, the United States has played a central role in systematic studies of the links between democracy and civil society. Although this is in part because trends in American life are often regarded as harbingers of social modernization, it is also because America has traditionally been considered unusually “civic” (a reputation that, as we shall later see, has not been entirely unjustified). When Tocqueville visited the United States in the 1830s, it was the Americans’ propensity for civic association that most impressed him as the key to their unprecedented ability to make democracy work. “Americans of all ages, all stations in life, and all types of disposition,” [End Page 65] he observed, “are forever forming associations. There are not only commercial and industrial associations in which all take part, but others of a thousand different types—religious, moral, serious, futile, very general and very limited, immensely large and very minute. . . . Nothing, in my view, deserves more attention than the intellectual and moral associations in America.” 1 Recently, American social scientists of a neo-Tocquevillean bent have unearthed a wide range of empirical evidence that the quality of public life and the performance of social institutions (and not only in America) are indeed powerfully influenced by norms and networks of civic engagement. Researchers in such fields as education, urban poverty, unemployment, the control of crime and drug abuse, and even health have discovered that successful outcomes are more likely in civically engaged communities. Similarly, research on the varying economic attainments of different ethnic groups in the United States has demonstrated the importance of social bonds within each group. These results are consistent with research in a wide range of settings that demonstrates the vital importance of social networks for job placement and many other economic outcomes. Meanwhile, a seemingly unrelated body of research on the sociology of economic development has also focused attention on the role of social networks. Some of this work is situated in the developing countries, and some of it elucidates the peculiarly successful “network capitalism” of East Asia. 2 Even in less exotic Western economies, however, researchers have discovered highly efficient, highly flexible “industrial districts” based on networks of collaboration among workers and small entrepreneurs. Far from being paleoindustrial anachronisms, these dense interpersonal and interorganizational networks undergird ultramodern industries, from the high tech of Silicon Valley to the high fashion of Benetton. The norms and networks of civic engagement also powerfully affect the performance of representative government. That, at least, was the central conclusion of my own 20-year, quasi-experimental study of subnational governments in different regions of Italy. 3 Although all these regional governments seemed identical on paper, their levels of effectiveness varied dramatically. Systematic inquiry showed that the quality of governance was determined by longstanding traditions of civic engagement (or its absence). Voter turnout, newspaper readership, membership in choral societies and football clubs—these were the hallmarks of a successful region. In fact, historical analysis suggested that these networks of organized reciprocity and civic solidarity, far from being an epiphenomenon of socioeconomic modernization, were a precondition for it. No doubt the mechanisms through which civic engagement and social connectedness produce such results—better schools, faster economic [End Page 66] development, lower crime, and more effective government—are multiple and complex. While these briefly recounted findings require further confirmation and perhaps qualification, the...",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Attention,13485

If more attention is given to sorting out these questions, “good enough governance” may become a more realistic goal for many countries faced with the goal of reducing poverty. Working toward good enough governance means accepting a more nuanced understanding of the evolution of institutions and government capabilities; being explicit about trade‐offs and priorities in a world in which all good things cannot be pursued at once; learning about what's working rather than focusing solely on governance gaps; taking the role of government in poverty alleviation seriously; and grounding action in the contextual realities of each country.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Attention,1177

Although the community governance and open collaboration model of Wikipedia confers many benefits, its decentralized nature can leave questions of information poverty and skewness to the mercy of the system's natural dynamics. In this paper, we leverage a large-scale natural experiment to gain a causal understanding of how exogenous content contributions to Wikipedia articles affect the attention that they attract and how that attention spills over to other articles in the information network. We find a positive feedback loop: content contribution leads to significant and long-lasting increases of attention and future contribution. Unfortunately, this also suggests that impoverished regions of information networks are likely to remain so in the absence of intervention. However, our analysis reveals a potential solution. Articles in impoverished regions of information networks are particularly positioned to benefit from the phenomenon of attention spillovers. Using a simulation that is calibrated with real-world link traffic of the Wikipedia network, we show that an attention contagion policy, which focuses editorial effort coherently on impoverished regions, can lead to as much as a twofold gain in attention relative to unguided contributions.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Attention,19

This paper argues that the indicators which are chosen to represent the phenomenon are often unduly restricted and even involve double counting.

However, recent years have witnessed an increasing preoccupation with the phenomenon of time poverty, drawing attention to the distribution of free time and its relationship to structural and family circumstances. In this article we propose a novel approach to the measurement of time poverty and document its occurrence amongst British workers. In line with previous literature, a conceptualization of time poverty as a relative lack of free time resources vis‐à‐vis other members of the community is adopted. However, unlike previous empirical studies, we investigate the differential configuration of time poverty on weekdays and weekend days, alongside indicators of the quality of free time, taking into account insights from theoretical and empirical work within the field of the sociology of time. Our analysis of the 2000 UK Time Use Survey highlights class and gender inequalities that have been missed by previous measurement approaches and demonstrates that, overall, working women experience multiple and more severe free time constraints, which may constitute an additional barrier for their leisure and social participation.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Attention,139

The idea of a ‘just transition’ increasingly features in policy and political discourse and appeals to the need to ensure that efforts to steer society towards a lower carbon future are underpinned by attention to issues of equity and justice: to those currently without access to reliable energy supplies and living in energy poverty and to those whose livelihoods are affected by and dependent on a fossil fuel economy. To complicate things further this transition has to be made compatible with the pursuit of ‘climate justice’ to current and future generations exposed to the social and ecological disruptions produced by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. Here we seek to identify and analyse the immensely difficult political trade‐offs that will characterise collective attempts to enact and realise a just transition. We explore procedural and distributional aspects of energy politics and practice in particular as they relate to the just transition: energy access for those who do not have it; justice for those who work within and are affected by the fossil fuel economy; and attempts to manage the potential contradictions that might flow from pursuing energy and climate justice simultaneously.,Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Attention,882
10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.3139,The Effects of Poverty on Childhood Brain Development,,"IMPORTANCE The study provides novel data to inform the mechanisms by which poverty negatively impacts childhood brain development. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether the income-to-needs ratio experienced in early childhood impacts brain development at school age and to explore the mediators of this effect. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study was conducted at an academic research unit at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis. Data from a prospective longitudinal study of emotion development in preschool children who participated in neuroimaging at school age were used to investigate the effects of poverty on brain development. Children were assessed annually for 3 to 6 years prior to the time of a magnetic resonance imaging scan, during which they were evaluated on psychosocial, behavioral, and other developmental dimensions. Preschoolers included in the study were 3 to 6 years of age and were recruited from primary care and day care sites in the St Louis metropolitan area; they were annually assessed behaviorally for 5 to 10 years. Healthy preschoolers and those with clinical symptoms of depression participated in neuroimaging at school age/early adolescence. EXPOSURE Household poverty as measured by the income-to-needs ratio. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Brain volumes of children's white matter and cortical gray matter, as well as hippocampus and amygdala volumes, obtained using magnetic resonance imaging. Mediators of interest were caregiver support/hostility measured observationally during the preschool period and stressful life events measured prospectively. RESULTS Poverty was associated with smaller white and cortical gray matter and hippocampal and amygdala volumes. The effects of poverty on hippocampal volume were mediated by caregiving support/hostility on the left and right, as well as stressful life events on the left. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The finding that exposure to poverty in early childhood materially impacts brain development at school age further underscores the importance of attention to the well-established deleterious effects of poverty on child development. Findings that these effects on the hippocampus are mediated by caregiving and stressful life events suggest that attempts to enhance early caregiving should be a focused public health target for prevention and early intervention. Findings substantiate the behavioral literature on the negative effects of poverty on child development and provide new data confirming that effects extend to brain development. Mechanisms for these effects on the hippocampus are suggested to inform intervention.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Attention,692
10.1080/00220380500405501,Shocks and their consequences across and within households in Rural Zimbabwe,,"Abstract Increasing attention is now being paid to poverty dynamics in developing countries. This work links the extent to which households smooth consumption or smooth assets given income shocks, the empirical evidence on the churning of households in and out of poverty, and the possibility that temporary shocks can have permanent consequences. Using longitudinal data from rural Zimbabwe, this paper extends the discussion of these issues by disaggregating the impact of shocks by levels of asset holdings, by disaggregating the impact of shocks on individual level welfare and by assessing the extent to which such shocks have permanent consequences. By doing so, it assesses the validity of distinguishing between asset and consumption smoothing and provides insights into whether poverty dynamics assessed at the household level provide an adequate picture of dynamics at the individual level.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Attention,426
10.1080/14649880600768538,Re‐thinking the “Feminization of Poverty” in Relation to Aggregate Gender Indices,,"The “feminization of poverty” is often referred to without adequate specification or substantiation, and does not necessarily highlight aspects of poverty that are most relevant to women at the grassroots. The United Nations Development Programme's gender indices go some way to reflecting gendered poverty, but there is scope for improvement. In order to work towards aggregate indices that are more sensitive to gender gaps in poverty as identified and experienced by poor women, the main aims of this paper are two‐fold. The first is to draw attention to existing conceptual and methodological weaknesses with the “feminization of poverty”, and to suggest how the construct could better depict contemporary trends in gendered privation. The second is to propose directions for the kinds of data and indicators that might be incorporated within the Gender‐related Development Index or the Gender Empowerment Measure, or used in the creation of a Gendered Poverty Index.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Attention,340
10.1017/s004727940300713x,Overlaps in Dimensions of Poverty,,"The Poverty and Social Exclusion Survey of Britain made it possible first time to explore poverty using three different measures applied at the same time on the same sample. The measures were: lacking socially perceived necessities; being subjectively poor and having a relatively low income. These approaches are all commonly used to identify the poor and to measure poverty but rarely if ever in combination. In this article we have found that there is little overlap in the group of people defined as poor by these dimensions. There are reasons for this lack of overlap, connected to the reliability and validity of the different measures. However the people who are defined as living in poverty by different measures of poverty are different. This inevitably means that the policy response to poverty will be different depending on which measure is employed. We have attempted to analyse overlap in two ways. First, by exploring the dimensions of poverty cumulatively, we have found that, the more dimensions people are poor on, the more they are unlike the non-poor and the poor on only one dimension, in their characteristics and in their social exclusion. Second, by treating particular dimensions as meriting more attention than others, we explored three permutations of this type and concluded that, while each permutation were more unlike the non-poor than those poor on a single dimension, they were not as unlike the non-poor as the cumulatively poor were. These results indicate that accumulation might be a better way of using overlapping measures of poverty than by giving priority to one dimension over another. The implication of the paper is that it is not safe to rely on one measure of poverty – the results obtained are just not reliable enough. Surveys, such as the Family Resources Survey or the European Community Household Panel, which are used to monitor the prevalence of poverty, need to be adapted to enable results to be triangulated – to incorporate a wider range of poverty measures.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Attention,365
10.1176/appi.ps.53.5.565,"Role of Social Disadvantage in Crime, Joblessness, and Homelessness Among Persons With Serious Mental Illness",,"Research on mental illness in relation to social problems such as crime, unemployment, and homelessness often ignores the broader social context in which mental illness is embedded. Policy, research, and practice will be improved if greater attention is given to social context. The authors critically analyze the approach used in much of the psychiatric services literature to infer links between mental illness and social problems. They compare these studies with studies that have been more validly conceptualized to account for social context. With this broader perspective, the impact of mental illness on crime, unemployment, and homelessness appears to be much smaller than that implied by much of the psychiatric services literature. Poverty moderates the relationship between serious mental illness and social problems. Factors related to poverty include lack of education, problems with employment, substance abuse, and a low likelihood of prosocial attachments. This relationship is often complicated and is not amenable to simple explanations. Research and policy that take this complexity into account may lead to greater effectiveness in interventions for persons with serious mental illness.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Attention,470

This paper begins by quantifying the extent and main characteristics of child labor. It then considers the evidence on a range of issues about child labor. Fundamentally, child labor is a symptom of poverty. Low income and poor institutions are driving forces behind the prevalence of child labor worldwide. This study concludes by assessing the policy options to reduce worldwide child labor.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Attention,450
10.1300/j013v12n03_02,Women and Poverty:,,"In the current debate about causes and cures for poverty, much attention is given to women. Women are more likely than men to be poor, and once impoverished, to remain poor for longer periods of time than do men. In addition, a much greater responsibility for raising the next generation of adults belongs to poor women than to poor men. No individual policy response will alleviate poverty among women. Rather, a multi-faceted policy response that recognizes the wide diversity of their situations is necessary. This paper describes the diversity among poor women and suggests a series of appropriate policies.In the current debate about the causes of and cures for poverty, much attention has been focused on women. Women are generally more likely than men to be poor and to remain poor for longer periods of time. By ignoring the diversity of the poor female population, policy makers fail to develop policies that address the needs of poor women in all categories. Instead, stereotypical descriptions of poor women and quick-fix solutions abound. Wilson examines the diverse characteristics of poor women and offers suggestions for more helpful policies. Wilson describes poor women in a series of statements, a sample of which follow. 1) Women who head their own households are nearly 5 times as likely to be poor as men who head their own households. 2) Over the past 2 1/2 decades, the share of poor people living in female-headed households has risen from 18% to 35%. 3) There are as many poor married women as poor women who head households. 4) Over the past 15 years, the average size of poor female-headed households has declined somewhat. 5) Only 1 in 5 poor women with children heading their own households receives any financial support from their children's fathers. 6) Nearly 6 in 10 poor women heading households received public assistance in 1984. Multiple strategies to combat poverty among poor women must be instituted. The most important antipoverty strategy is creation of a productive, high-employment economy. Most poor women work, but have low wages and too few work hours. Other helpful policies include raising the minimum wage, providing health coverage to uninsured or inadequately insured working poor families, and increasing financial support for child care. Improving the educational system, discouraging high school drop-outs, and discouraging early pregnancy would also help, as would enforcing child support payments and extending public assistance to 2-parent families in poverty. Increasing benefit levels to all eligible households would further diminish poverty. None of these strategies is effective alone; only a multifaceted antipoverty strategy will be effective.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Attention,120
10.1002/jtr.727,The possible negative impacts of volunteer tourism,,"Abstract Volunteer tourism is an increasingly popular form of travel that is attracting growing research attention. Nevertheless, existing research has focused primarily on the benefits of volunteer tourism, and many studies have simply involved profiling volunteers or investigating their motivations. However, there are numerous possible negative impacts of volunteer tourism that deserve increased attention from both researchers and project managers: a neglect of locals' desires, a hindering of work progress and completion of unsatisfactory work, a disruption of local economies, a reinforcement of conceptualisations of the ‘other’ and rationalisations of poverty, and an instigation of cultural changes.

Global inequality increased with the latest revision of the ICP, and this reduced the global poverty line relative to the US dollar. The recent large increase of nearly half a billion poor people came from an inappropriate updating of the global poverty line, not from the ICP revisions. Even so, PPP comparisons between widely different countries rest on weak theoretical and empirical foundations. I argue for wider use of self-reports from international monitoring surveys, and for a global poverty line that is truly denominated in US dollars.

10.1177/00139160121972846,Coping with Poverty,,"Considerable evidence suggests that exposure to “green” environments can enhance human effectiveness and make life’s demands seem manageable. Does this phenomenon extend to poor inner cities, where green space is minimal and life’s demands may be overwhelming? In 145 urban public housing residents randomly assigned to buildings with and without nearby nature, attentional functioning and effectiveness in managing major life issues were compared. Residents living in buildings without nearby trees and grass reported more procrastination in facing their major issues and assessed their issues as more severe, less soluble, and more longstanding than did their counterparts living in greener surroundings. Mediation tests and extensive tests for possible confounds supported the attention restoration hypothesis— that green space enhances residents’ effectiveness by reducing mental fatigue. These findings suggest that urban public housing environments could be configured to enhance residents’ psychological resources for coping with poverty.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Attention,434
10.1017/s0047279400019280,"Resources, Deprivation and the Measurement of Poverty",,"Abstract Ringen has advocated the use of both income and deprivation criteria in identifying those excluded from society due to lack of resources, a widely accepted definition of poverty. We illustrate with Irish data how this might be done, paying particular attention to how appropriate indicators of deprivation are to be selected. The results show that employing both income and deprivation criteria rather than income alone can make a substantial difference to both the extent and composition of measured poverty. This highlights the restrictive nature of poverty conceived in terms of exclusion rather than minimum rights to resources.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Attention,303

Unfortunately, inadequate attention has been directed at considering the historical roots of the discursive framework within which hazard is generally presented, and how that might reflect particular cultural values to do with the way in which certain regions or zones of the world are usually imagined. This paper argues that tropicality, development and vulnerability form part of one and the same essentialising and generalising cultural discourse that denigrates large regions of world as disease-ridden, poverty-stricken and disaster-prone.",Openalex,Psychology-related,Poverty and Attention,451
