10.1002/jclp.21951,Poverty and Mental Health: How Do Low‐Income Adults and Children Fare in Psychotherapy?,,"Poverty is associated with an increased risk for psychological problems. Even with this increased risk for mental health problems and need for care, many low-income adults and families do not receive treatment because of logistical, attitudinal, and systemic barriers. Despite significant barriers to obtaining care, research suggests that low-income individuals show significant benefit from evidence-based mental healthcare. In this article, we review the link between poverty and mental health, common barriers to obtaining mental health services, and treatment studies that have been conducted with low-income groups. Finally, we discuss the implications of the research reviewed and offer recommendations for clinicians working with low-income children or adults, highlighting the importance of evidence-based care, extensive outreach, and empathic respect.",2012,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and mental health,240
10.2307/2095905,"Poverty, Parenting, and Children's Mental Health",,"Poor children experience greater psychological distress than do nonpoor children. However, evidence for the relationship between poverty and children's distress is limited by the use of measures of poverty at a single point in time, by a failure to examine race or ethnic differences, and by a lack of concern with explanations for poverty's effects. Using data from the 1986 Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) data set, we explored the relationships among current poverty, length of time spent in poverty, maternal parenting behaviors, and children's mental health. Persistent poverty significantly predicts children's internalizing symptoms above and beyond the effect of current poverty, whereas only current poverty predicts externalizing symptoms. Mother's weak emotional responsiveness and frequent use of physical punishment explain the effect of current poverty on mental health, but not the effect of persistent poverty. The relationships among poverty, parenting behaviors, and children's mental health do not vary by race/ethnicity. These findings support theoretical developments calling for greater emphasis on family processes in studies of children's poverty. They also argue for greater attention to trajectories of socioeconomic status in analyses of the effects of status on mental health.",1993,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and mental health,834

Children who were poor in 1986 or who had prior histories of poverty had higher levels of depression and antisocial behavior in that year. Furthermore, subsequent poverty histories were also related to children's mental health trajectories. The number of years that children were poor between 1986 and 1990 correlates significantly with changes in children's antisocial behavior during those years. Finally, rates of increase in antisocial behavior were substantially higher for children with histories of persistent poverty during those years than for transiently poor or nonpoor children.

Methods An online survey was conducted with a nationally-drawn sample (N = 471) of college-attending women to assess the association between period poverty and depression. Period poverty was measured via two questions designed for this study; depression was measured with the standard PHQ-9. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized for analysis. Results Among our sample, 14.2% of women had experienced period poverty ever in the past-year; an additional 10% experienced it every month. Compared to those who had never experienced period poverty, adjusted analysis revealed that women with monthly past-year period poverty were the most likely to report moderate/severe depression (AOR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.09–4.99), followed by those who had experienced it ever in the past year (AOR = 1.83, 95% CI, 0.99–3.38). Conclusion Many young women cannot afford menstrual health products to meet their monthly needs, and this may impact their mental well-being.

The study population comprised a sample from 14400 (n = 519 Somali and n = 906 Rwandese) refugees resident in Nakivale refugee settlement in South Western Uganda during the year 2003.The Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS) and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist 25 were used to screen for posttraumatic stress disorder and depression.Thirty two percent of the Rwandese and 48.1% of the Somali refugees were found to suffer from PTSD. The Somalis refugees had a mean of 11.95 (SD = 6.17) separate traumatic event types while the Rwandese had 8.86 (SD = 5.05).

In population-based data, this is partially explained by income differences between bisexual people and lesbian, gay, and/or heterosexual individuals. However, the interrelationships between bisexuality, poverty, and mental health are poorly understood. In this paper, we examine the relationships between these variables using a mixed methods study of 302 adult bisexuals from Ontario, Canada. Participants were recruited using respondent-driven sampling to complete an internet-based survey including measures of psychological distress and minority stress. A subset of participants completed a semi-structured qualitative interview to contextualize their mental health experiences. Using information regarding household income, number of individuals supported by the income and geographic location, participants were categorized as living below or above the Canadian Low Income Cut Off (LICO). Accounting for the networked nature of the sample, participants living below the LICO had significantly higher mean scores for depression and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and reported significantly more perceived discrimination compared to individuals living above the LICO. Grounded theory analysis of the qualitative interviews suggested four pathways through which bisexuality and poverty may intersect to impact mental health: through early life experiences linked to bisexuality or poverty that impacted future financial stability; through effects of bisexual identity on employment and earning potential; through the impact of class and sexual orientation discrimination on access to communities of support; and through lack of access to mental health services that could provide culturally competent care. These mixed methods data help us understand the income disparities associated with bisexual identity in population-based data, and suggest points of intervention to address their impact on bisexual mental health.",2016,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and mental health,63

Employing a two-wave socioeconomic survey, we analyzed the impact of multidimensional energy poverty on mental health in Ghana. We found energy poverty to heighten the chances of being mentally unhealthy. Using prices of liquefied petroleum gas and electricity as instruments for multidimensional energy poverty, we found that a rise in energy deprivation is associated with a 0.562-, 1.494- and 1.867-fold increase in the odds of being mildly, moderately and severely depressed, respectively. Among the indicators of multidimensional energy poverty, a deprivation in household appliance ownership (refrigerator ownership), recorded the highest impact on the depression levels of household heads.

This study examined the differential effects of poverty on the mental health of foreign-born children, Canadian-born children of immigrant parents, and children of nonimmigrant parents. Methods. Secondary analysis of data from a national Canadian study of children between 4 and 11 years of age was conducted. Results. Compared with their receiving-society counterparts, foreign-born children were more than twice as likely to live in poor families, but they had lower levels of emotional and behavioral problems. The effect of poverty on children's mental health among long-term immigrant and receiving-society families was indirect and primarily mediated by single-parent status, ineffective parenting, parental depression, and family dysfunction. In comparison, the mental health effect of poverty among foreign-born children could not be explained by the disadvantages that poor families often suffer. Conclusions. Poverty may represent a transient and inevitable part of the resettlement process for new immigrant families.

METHODS: Data were collected from a probability sample of 912 men (self-identified as both Latino and nonheterosexual) recruited from the venues and public social spaces identified as both Latino and gay in the cities of Miami, Los Angeles, and New York. RESULTS: The study showed high prevalence rates of psychologic symptoms of distress in the population of gay Latino men during the 6 months before the interview, including suicidal ideation (17% prevalence), anxiety (44%), and depressed mood (80%). In both univariate and multivariate analyses, experiences of social discrimination were strong predictors of psychologic symptoms.

10.1002/smi.2646,Exposure to Childhood Poverty and Mental Health Symptomatology in Adolescence: A Role of Coping Strategies,,"Childhood poverty is associated with stress dysregulation which contributes to psychological illness in later ages. The adverse effects of childhood poverty on stress regulation may be mediated in part by the use of disengaging strategies to cope with stress. However, the relations among childhood poverty, coping strategies and psychopathology throughout childhood to adolescence have not been explored. This prospective, longitudinal study included 185 low- and middle-income adolescents at age 17. Chronic exposure to poverty from birth to early adolescence (age 13) was prospectively associated with increases in the use of disengagement versus engagement coping four years later. Increased use of disengagement coping between the ages of 13 and 17 explained the indirect link between poverty exposure since birth and both externalizing and internalizing symptoms at age 17. The findings provide evidence for a coping pathway underlying the link between prolonged exposure to childhood poverty and mental health sequelae.

10.2307/353111,"Does Neighborhood and Family Poverty Affect Mothers' Parenting, Mental Health, and Social Support?",,"How neighborhoods affect families living in them has emerged as a key question in understanding the causes and effects of urban poverty. Over the last 20 years people with low incomes have become increasingly likely to live in metropolitan areas and in neighborhoods with a high concentration of low-income people (Jargowsky & Bane, 1990; Jencks & Peterson, 1991; Wacquant & Wilson, 1989; Wilson, 1987). This is particularly true for economically disadvantaged blacks and Hispanics, and for metropolitan areas in the Northeast and Midwest (Jargowsky & Bane, 1990). Some of the ways in which neighborhoods affect individuals have been elucidated in recent literature, although the focus of almost all existing work has been on adolescents and young adults, not on children or parents. Few studies have looked at the processes by which neighborhoods influence families, especially parents, and, in turn, how parents are likely to influence their children. This article addresses the question of how both neighborhood and family conditions might influence the ways in which parents behave. In The Truly Disadvantaged, Wilson (1987) undertook an analysis of the structural changes in postindustrial society that contributed to an increase in the number of poor and jobless people in inner-city neighborhoods. Wilson also has attempted to model linkages between structural changes and the behavior of residents of inner-city, poor neighborhoods. Much of the related work to date has focused on documenting the association between the increased poverty and joblessness in neighborhoods with a decline in jobs (especially jobs not demanding high literacy skills) in central cities (Freeman, 1991; Kasarda, 1990) and with the movement of more highly skilled and advantaged residents out of the inner cities (Wilson, 1987; however, see Massey & Eggers, 1990). Recently, Wilson (1991a, 1991b) has gone beyond structural changes to examine some of the familial and cultural processes that might result from living in neighborhoods with high concentrations of jobless men and family poverty. He suggested that living in neighborhoods in which relatively few individuals hold jobs, few jobs are located within the neighborhood, and single-parent households are prevalent may produce what he terms social isolation; these conditions in turn may produce socialization practices and family life styles that do not reinforce practices associated with steady employment. Postulated characteristics include a focus on the present rather than the future, poor planning and organization, little sense of personal control over events, and a lack of emphasis on school or job-related skills. This constellation of familial conditions might be expressed, and measured, through psychological dimensions such as coping behavior, self-efficacy, problem solving, and present-future orientation, as well as dimensions of family process, such as parenting behavior, organization of the household, and the provision of learning experiences for their children. While this hypothesis has received some attention, it has not been tested directly. Thus, little is known about whether or how neighborhoods may affect maternal characteristics and behaviors. Rather, the primary focus of research has been on how family-level poverty affects parents and children. Research bearing on the effect of family poverty has documented the association between poverty and greater psychological distress and depression (Belle, 1990; Belle, Longfellow, & Makosky, 1982; Danziger & Stern, 1990; McLoyd & Wilson, 1991; Parker, Greer, & Zuckerman, 1988). Poor families have to deal with a greater number of daily stresses which over time weaken their ability to handle subsequent stress (McLoyd, 1990). Both the inability to control the source of the stress, and the inability to cope or handle the stress itself contributes to the deleterious effect on psychological functioning (Makosky, 1982). …",1994,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and mental health,550

On a meso-level, on neighborhood-related poverty as a factor in individuals' mental illness. On a macro-level, on effects of income inequality on mental health. In several studies, it has been shown that on each level, poverty has a profound impact on mental health, though it must be noted that in some fields, research is still scarce.

10.1136/bmj.330.7486.307-b,Poverty and mental health,,"The organic anion transporting polypeptide OATP2B1 is localized on the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and is expressed in enterocytes. Based on its distribution pattern and functional similarity to OATP1B-type transporters, OATP2B1 might have a role in the absorption and disposition of a range of xenobiotics. Although several prescription drugs, including HMG-CoA inhibitors (statins) such as fluvastatin, are OATP2B1 substrates in vitro, evidence supporting the in vivo relevance of this transporter remains limited, and most has relied on substrate-inhibitor interactions resulting in altered pharmacokinetic properties of the victim drugs. In order to address this knowledge deficit, we developed and characterized an OATP2B1-deficient mouse model and evaluated the impact of this transporter on the absorption and disposition of fluvastatin. Consistent with the intestinal localization of OATP2B1, we found that the genetic or pharmacological inhibition of OATP2B1 was associated with decreased absorption of fluvastatin by 2- to 3-fold. The availability of a viable OATP2B1-deficient mouse model provides an opportunity to unequivocally determine the contribution of this transporter to the absorption and drug-drug interaction potential of drugs. <h3>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</h3> The current investigation suggests that OATP2B1-deficient mice provide a valuable tool to study the in vivo importance of this transporter. In addition, our studies have identified novel potent inhibitors of OATP2B1 among the class of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, a rapidly expanding class of drugs used in various therapeutic areas that may cause drug-drug interactions with OATP2B1 substrates.",2005,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and mental health,18

These results maintained independently of concurrent, adult income levels for self-reported externalizing symptoms and a standard learned helplessness behavioral protocol, but internalizing symptoms were unaffected by childhood poverty. We then demonstrate that part of the reason why early poverty exposure is harmful to mental health among emerging adults is because of elevated cumulative risk exposure assessed at age 13.

However, to have an influence on the next set of sustainable global development goals, we need to understand the causal relationships between social determinants such as poverty, inequality, lack of education and unemployment; thereby clarifying which aspects of poverty are the key drivers of mental illness. Some of the major challenges identified by Lund (2014) in understanding the poverty-mental health relationship are discussed including: the need for appropriate poverty indicators; extending this research agenda to a broader range of mental health outcomes; the need to engage with theoretical concepts such as Amartya Sen's capability framework; and the need to integrate the concept of income/economic inequality into studies of poverty and mental health. Although income inequality is a powerful driver of poor physical and mental health outcomes, it features rarely in research and discourse on social determinants of mental health. This paper interrogates in detail the relationships between poverty, income inequality and mental health, specifically: the role of income inequality as a mediator of the poverty-mental health relationship; the relative utility of commonly used income inequality metrics; and the likely mechanisms underlying the impact of inequality on mental health, including direct stress due to the setting up of social comparisons as well as the erosion of social capital leading to social fragmentation. Finally, we need to interrogate the upstream political, social and economic causes of inequality itself, since these should also become potential targets in efforts to promote sustainable development goals and improve population (mental) health. In particular, neoliberal (market-oriented) political doctrines lead to both increased income inequality and reduced social cohesion.

10.1111/spc3.12168,The Psychiatrization of Poverty: Rethinking the Mental Health–Poverty Nexus,,"Abstract The positive association between ‘mental illness’ and poverty is one of the most well established in psychiatric epidemiology. Yet, there is little conclusive evidence about the nature of this relationship. Generally, explanations revolve around the idea of a vicious cycle, where poverty may cause mental ill health, and mental ill health may lead to poverty. Problematically, much of the literature overlooks the historical, social, political, and cultural trajectories of constructions of both poverty and ‘mental illness’. Laudable attempts to explore the social determinants of mental health sometimes take recourse to using and reifying psychiatric diagnostic categories that individualize distress and work to psychiatrically reconfigure ‘symptoms’ of oppression, poverty, and inequality as ‘symptoms’ of ‘mental illness’. This raises the paradoxical issue that the very tools that are used to research the relationship between poverty and mental health may prevent recognition of the complexity of that relationship. Looking at the mental health–poverty nexus through a lens of psychiatrization (intersecting with medicalization, pathologization, and psychologization), this paper recognizes the need for radically different tools to trace the messiness of the multiple relationships between poverty and distress. It also implies radically different interventions into mental health and poverty that recognize the landscapes in which lived realities of poverty are embedded, the political economy of psychiatric diagnostic and prescribing practices, and ultimately to address the systemic causes of poverty and inequality.",2015,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and mental health,97

Design/methodology/approach The paper first reviews the findings of relevant research on mental disorders and poverty and then proposes solutions that can be adopted by countries to promote development. Findings This evidence of strong links between poverty and mental disorder supports the argument that mental disorders should be an important concern for development strategies. Mental disorders have diverse and far‐reaching social impacts, including homelessness, higher rates of imprisonment, poor educational opportunities and outcomes, lack of employment and reduced income. Targeted poverty alleviation programmes are needed to break the cycle between mental illness and poverty. These must include measures specifically addressing the needs of people with mental health conditions, such as the provision of accessible and effective services and support, facilitation of education, employment opportunities and housing, and enforcement of human rights protection. Originality/value The paper highlights that four out of every five people suffering from mental disorders are living in LMICs. Many LMICs have identified mental health as an important issue, yet lack the finances and technical expertise to address the problem. Having mental health on the agenda of development organizations will be a critical step for overcoming the negative development consequences of mental disorders.",2012,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and mental health,117

The scientific literature shows that stoicism can contribute to the temporary reduction of stress, but it gradually leads to a uselessness feeling which tends to make difficult the psychosocial adjustment to the disease and its treatment.",2007,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and mental health,30

Those belonging to marginalized sections face the brunt of lack of access to water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities; affordable menstrual supplies; and inequitable distribution of menstrual health education and are victims of period poverty. Their preexisting suffering was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which negatively affected the mental health of those menstruating. Adolescent girls and women in communities found it persistently challenging to access and afford menstrual products while deprived of menstrual hygiene education. These put them under immense stress and elevated financial liability, predisposing them to period poverty. Interventions addressing period poverty rely on mustering collective community voices and deploying adequate policy tools. All the efforts and solutions must provide social and financial protection nets and psychological aid through mental health support groups. It is core to drive menstrual health equity for all menstruators, irrespective of who they are, what they do, and where they live.",2023,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and mental health,25

10.1186/s12905-023-02328-w,"Period poverty and mental health in a representative sample of young women in Barcelona, Spain",,"Abstract Background The intersection between poverty and mental health is clear. Period poverty, understood as the lack of access to menstrual products, has been gaining attention especially among low and middle-income countries as an overlooked aspect of gendered poverty. Less is known about the incidence of period poverty in high-income countries and its association with mental health. The purpose of this study is to examine this association in a representative sample of young women living in an urban setting in southern Europe. Methods This is a cross-sectional study. Data were obtained from a representative survey of individuals aged 15 to 34 in the city of Barcelona (Spain), with a sample group of 647 young women. Subjects were selected through a systematic stratified random sampling method. A proportional quota sampling was used. The information was registered using CAPI data collection method. Period poverty was measured by a combination of three questions about the lack of access or misuse of menstrual products for economic reasons. The GHQ-12 was used to measure the risk of poor mental health. The analysis was carried out using multivariable logistic regression. Results From our sample, 15.3% of young women reported having experienced period poverty. Higher odds of poor mental health were estimated for women facing period poverty (AOR = 1.85 p &lt; 0.05). This effect is statistically significant after controlling by their income status and level of deprivation. Young women living in poorer households have a higher probability of poor mental health than those living in high-income households (AOR = 0.47 p &lt; 0.05). Finally, material deprivation was associated to an increased risk of poor mental health among young women reporting period poverty (AOR = 2.59 p &lt; 0.01). Conclusion We found that a considerable number of young women living in an urban setting in a high-income country cannot afford menstrual products, and this may have an impact on their mental wellbeing. The relationship between period poverty and respondents’ mental health is significant when controlling for factors known to confer an increased risk of poor mental health. If confirmed by further research, the public health burden of poor mental health in young women could be reduced by policy-level interventions to improve access to menstrual products.",2023,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and mental health,17

Single and married mothers were followed up over a 2-year period during which time rates of psychosocial risk factors, onset of depression and experience of chronic episodes were measured. Risk of onset was double among single mothers. Single mothers were twice as likely as their married counterparts to be in financial hardship, despite being twice as likely to be in full-time employment. Both of these factors were independently associated with onset in single mothers. The link between them and onset was via their association with humiliating or entrapping severe life events. Single parents were at a much raised risk of experiencing these events. Onset was also more likely to follow such an event when women had poor self-esteem and lack of support, both of which were more common among single mothers. These risk factors were more frequently found among those in financial hardship. Financial hardship was also related to risk of having a chronic episode (lasting at least a year), of which single parents were also at greater risk. The majority of chronic episodes among single mothers had their origins in prior marital difficulties or widowhood and rates of chronicity reduced with length of time spent in single parenthood. Results are discussed in terms of an aetiological model of onset in which financial hardship probably influences outcome at a wide variety of points.",1997,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Depression,449

In this study for a recent birth cohort of UK children we examine how three aspects of parental resources – income, mother's mental well-being and family status – in early childhood enhance or compromise their children's cognitive and behavioural development. As well as examining how these three aspects of parental resources separately and jointly affect children's well-being, we also enquire whether persistent poverty or persistent maternal depression are more deleterious for children's current well-being than periodic episodes of poverty and depression. We find strong associations between poverty and young children's intellectual and behavioural development, and persistent poverty was found to be particularly important in relation to children's cognitive development. Maternal depression (net of other factors) was more weakly related to cognitive development but strongly related to whether children were exhibiting behaviour problems, and persistent depression amplified the situation. Family status, net of other factors (most noticeably poverty), was only weakly associated with children's development.",2009,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Depression,181

In a combined sample of low-income women (N = 210), we tested a dual-pathway model to explain how these perceived stigma dimensions are related to depression among the impoverished. We proposed that interpersonal (i.e., impaired support availability and heightened fear of support request rejection) and intrapersonal factors (i.e., impaired self-esteem) differentially mediate the relationship of internalized and experienced poverty stigma with depression. Structural equation modeling partially supported the model: internalized stigma and depression were partially mediated by self-esteem and fear of rejection, while experienced stigma was related to depression through fear of rejection only. In other words, internalized and experienced perceived stigma activate separate and similar mechanisms to influence depression among the poor.",2008,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Depression,119

This study builds on this work by focusing on one mechanism that links material hardship to child outcomes, namely the mediating effect of maternal depression. Using data from the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey, we found that maternal depression and poverty jeopardized the development of very young boys and girls, and to a certain extent, affluence buffered the deleterious consequences of depression. Results also showed that chronic maternal depression had severe implications for both boys and girls, whereas persistent poverty had a strong effect for the development of girls. The measures of poverty and maternal depression used in this study generally had a greater impact on measures of cognitive development than motor development.",2001,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Depression,559

Positive parenting behavior may buffer against the negative impact of child AIDS-orphanhood and caregiver AIDS-sickness on child well-being. Although there is substantial literature regarding the predictors of parenting behavior in Western populations, there is insufficient evidence on HIV/AIDS as a risk factor for poor parenting in low- and middle-income countries. This paper examines the relationship between HIV/AIDS and positive parenting by comparing HIV/AIDS-affected and nonaffected caregiver-child dyads (n=2477) from a cross-sectional survey in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (27.7% AIDS-ill caregivers; 7.4% child AIDS-orphanhood). Multiple mediation analyses tested an ecological model with poverty, caregiver depression, perceived social support, and child behavior problems as potential mediators of the association of HIV/AIDS with positive parenting. Results indicate that familial HIV/AIDS's association to reduced positive parenting was consistent with mediation by poverty, caregiver depression, and child behavior problems. Parenting interventions that situate positive parenting within a wider ecological framework by improving child behavior problems and caregiver depression may buffer against risks for poor child mental and physical health outcomes in families affected by HIV/AIDS and poverty.",2013,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Depression,97

METHOD: The authors studied a group of pregnant mothers recruited during their third trimester of pregnancy from a district hospital in Goa, India. The mothers were interviewed at recruitment, 6–8 weeks, and 6 months after childbirth. Interview data included presence of antenatal and postnatal depression, obstetric history, economic and demographic characteristics, and gender-based variables (preference for male infant, presence of marital violence). RESULTS: Depressive disorder was detected in 59 (23%) of the mothers at 6–8 weeks after childbirth; 78% of these patients had had clinically substantial psychological morbidity during the antenatal period. More than one-half of the patients remained ill at 6 months after delivery. Economic deprivation and poor marital relationships were important risk factors for the occurrence and chronicity of depression. The gender of the infant was a determinant of postnatal depression; it modified the effect of other risk factors, such as marital violence and hunger. Depressed mothers were more disabled and were more likely to use health services than nondepressed mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal and infant health policies, a priority in low-income countries, must integrate maternal depression as a disorder of public health significance. Interventions should target mothers in the antenatal period and incorporate a strong gender-based component.",2002,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Depression,770

Parallel research on economic inequalities and depression has just begun. Discrimination maintains inequalities, condemns women to lives of lessened economic security, and exposes them to unmerited contempt.

More specifically, we use conditional logistic fixed‐effect models that control for time‐invariant unmeasured heterogeneity in the sample. Results. We found a strong relationship between hardships and depression. The most prominent hardships were problems paying bills and phone turned off. We also found that hardship helped mediate much, though not all, of the link between poverty and depression in the conditional fixed‐effects logistic regression models. Conclusion.

Analyzing the relationship between energy poverty and the depression level of China's older adults will provide policy enlightenment for solving the problems of older adults' relative poverty, energy poverty, and mental poverty and thus promote happy and healthy aging. In this paper, using the data of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study in 2018, we used the entropy weighting method to objectively assign weights to 10 indicators reflecting the status of energy poverty and construct a multidimensional energy poverty index for older adults. First, we analyzed the relationship between multidimensional energy poverty and the depression levels of older adults using multiple linear regression model and quantile regression models. Next, we used instrumental variable linear regression model and instrumental variable quantile regression models for endogeneity tests. Then, we performed a robustness check by replacing the core explanatory variable. After that, we conducted heterogeneity analyses by residential area, type of residence, and solitary status. Finally, we analyzed the mediating role of life satisfaction using structural equation modeling. Multidimensional energy poverty has aggravated depression among older adults, and the effect is greater for older adults with higher depression levels. The effect of multidimensional energy poverty on depression is greater for older adults in western China, urban areas, and those who live alone. Multidimensional energy poverty has aggravated depression among older adults by reducing their life satisfaction.",2022,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Depression,15

We used a birth cohort study of a sample of women in Brisbane, Australia, who were recruited in early pregnancy and whose children were followed up on at ages 14 and 21 years. Some 2609 mothers and adolescents provided usable data at the 14- and 21-year follow-ups. Results. After adjustment for poverty at other phases, poverty at the 14-year follow-up was the strongest predictor of adolescent and young adult anxiety and depression. The more frequently the child was exposed to poverty, the greater was the risk of that individual being anxious and depressed at both the 14- and 21-year follow-ups. Conclusions. Family poverty predicts higher rates of adolescent and young adult anxiety and depression. Increased frequency of child exposure to poverty is a consistent predictor of adolescent and young adult anxiety and depression.

This effect was greater with repeated exposure to high maternal anxiety and depression. Poverty, distressed marital relationship and marital break-up during the child's first five years also produced small, but significant, increases in risk of high anxiety and depression symptoms in adolescence. Stable, single-parent status was not found to be a risk factor. There was no evidence of marked gender differences in risk factors, other than poverty, which had a stronger impact for girls than boys.Overall, the results suggest that maternal anxiety and depression, poverty, parent relationship conflict and marital break-up during early childhood are associated with small, but significant, increased risk of anxiety-depression symptoms in adolescence.",2002,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Depression,190

To determine whether the processes through which parenting practices, maternal depression, neighborhood, and chronic poverty affect child behavioral problems are similar or different in minority and nonminority children in the United States. METHODS. Data from 884 white, 538 black, and 404 Latino families with children who were 6 to 9 years of age in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth were analyzed. The outcome, child behavioral problems, was measured using the Behavior Problems Index externalizing and internalizing subscales. The effects of chronic poverty, neighborhood, maternal depression, and parenting on the outcome were analyzed using multigroup structural equation modeling. RESULTS. Chronic poverty affected child behavioral problems indirectly through the other variables, and parenting practices had direct effects in each racial/ethnic group. The effects of maternal depression were partially mediated through parenting in the white and Latino samples but were direct and unmediated through parenting practices in the black sample. Neighborhood effects were present in the white and black samples but were not significant for the Latino sample. CONCLUSIONS. Chronic poverty, neighborhood, maternal depression, and parenting practices have effects on child behavioral problems in white, black, and Latino children, but the processes and mechanisms through which they exert their effects differ among the groups.

In this study, we investigate the impact of energy poverty on depression among rural Chinese individuals aged 16 and above, and our sample includes 13,784 individuals from 6103 households. With data from the 2018 China Family Panel Studies, we apply the instrumental variable (IV) quantile regression approach to address the potential endogeneity of energy poverty and allow for heterogeneous effects of energy poverty on depression across individuals with different levels of depression. Our estimates from the IV quantile regression suggest a strong positive impact of energy poverty on depression at the upper quantile of depression scores, but no impact at the middle and lower quantiles. The primary results are robust and consistent with alternative energy poverty measures, and we find that energy poverty does not affect depression of low-risk individuals (with low depression scores), but it does affect that of high-risk individuals.

Preschoolers 3-5 years of age were originally ascertained from primary care and day care sites in the St. Louis area and then underwent annual behavioral assessments for up to 12 years. Healthy preschoolers and those with a history of depression symptoms underwent neuroimaging at school age. Using functional MRI, the authors examined whole brain resting-state functional connectivity with the left and right hippocampus and amygdala.Lower income-to-needs ratio at preschool age was associated with reduced connectivity between hippocampus and amygdala and a number of regions at school age, including the superior frontal cortex, lingual gyrus, posterior cingulate, and putamen. Lower income-to-needs ratio predicted greater negative mood/depression severity at school age, as did connectivity between the left hippocampus and the right superior frontal cortex and between the right amygdala and the right lingual gyrus. Connectivity mediated the relationship between income-to-needs ratio and negative mood/depression at the time of scanning.These findings suggest that poverty in early childhood, as assessed by at least one measure, may influence the development of hippocampal and amygdala connectivity in a manner leading to negative mood symptoms during later childhood.",2016,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Depression,125

We describe the prevalence and risk factors for depression during pregnancy, in particular the association with poverty and violence, in a Brazilian setting. Method. A cross-sectional survey of women in the third trimester of pregnancy attending a public hospital maternity clinic from August 2003 to July 2004 in Rio de Janeiro. Participants were interviewed about their sociodemographic status, obstetric and medical conditions, substance use, stressful life events, and social support. Depression was diagnosed through the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Results. A total of 230 of 240 eligible women consented to participate. The 12-month prevalence of depression was 19·1% (95% CI 14·4–24·9). On multivariate analyses, having been educated beyond primary school was protective (OR 0·5, 95% CI 0·2–0·9).

Our review identified over 40 relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals from the mid-1990s to 2001, the take-off point for an increasing level of interest in neighborhood effects. Moving beyond traditional characteristics such as concentrated poverty, we evaluate the salience of social-interactional and institutional mechanisms hypothesized to account for neighborhood-level variations in a variety of phenomena (e.g., delinquency, violence, depression, high-risk behavior), especially among adolescents. We highlight neighborhood ties, social control, mutual trust, institutional resources, disorder, and routine activity patterns.

Little is known about the specific elements of poverty that contribute to depression, particularly among African American women at risk for type 2 diabetes. This study examined the relationships of economic and social resources to depression among African American women at high risk for the development of type 2 diabetes (N = 181) using the Conservation of Resources theory as a conceptual framework. Women were assessed at 3 time points in conjunction with a dietary change intervention. At baseline, 40% of women reported clinically significant depression, and 43.3% were below the poverty line. Depressed women reported fewer economic assets and greater economic distress than nondepressed peers. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that nonwork status, lack of home ownership, low appraisal of one's economic situation, low self-esteem, and increased life events were significantly associated with depression at baseline. Longitudinal multivariate logistic regression models indicated that income, home ownership, future economic appraisal, life events, and self-esteem predicted depression trajectories at Time 3. These results speak to the multifaceted sources of stress in the lives of poor African American women. Interventions that address the economic and social factors associated with depression are needed.",2003,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Depression,51

This article explores two similar but underutilized theoretical frameworks in medical anthropology, and discusses how they facilitate new insights about the relationships between epidemiological patterns and individual-level illness experiences. Two cases from our fieldwork in New Delhi and Chicago are presented to illustrate how syndemics and chronicity theories explain the epidemic problems of co-occurring depression and type 2 diabetes. We use these case studies to illustrate how the holistic agendas of syndemics and chronicity theories allow critical scholars to attend to the macrosocial factors contributing to the rise of noncommunicable diseases while still honoring the diversity of experiences that make individual illness experiences, and actual outcomes, unique. Such an approach not only promotes a more integrative medical anthropology, but also contributes to global health dialogues around diabetes, depression, and their overlap.",2013,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Depression,82

At 18 months infant age, the home-visited infants were compared with 2 groups of socioeconomically similar unserved infants on measures of infant development, infant attachment, mother-infant interaction, maternal depression, and maternal social contacts. Home-visited infants of depressed mothers outperformed unserved infants of depressed mothers by an average of 10 points on the Bayley Mental Scale and were twice as likely to be classified as securely attached, with unserved high-risk infants showing a high rate of insecure-disorganized attachments. Duration of services was positively correlated with maternal involvement at 12 months. Results of the study point both to the negative developmental consequences associated with severe social risk conditions and to the buffering effects of developmentally oriented home-visiting services for infants at greatest social risk.",1990,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Depression,431

The present study examines the year-long prospective relationships among poverty-related stress, involuntary engagement stress response (IESR) levels, and anxiety symptoms and aggression in an ethnically diverse sample of 98 families (300 individual family members) living at or below 150% of the US federal poverty line. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) moderator model analyses provided strong evidence that IESR levels moderated the influence of poverty-related stress on anxiety symptoms and provided mixed evidence for the same interaction effect on aggression. Higher IESR levels, a proxy for physiological stress reactivity, worsened the impact of stress on symptoms.

One quarter of the sample were American Indian, and the remaining were predominantly white.

Recent scientific advances in cognitive process models and in the neurobiology of parenting indicate that parenting is shaped in part by conscious and nonconscious cognitive processes. This study extends a growing literature on neurocognitive models of parenting by exploring the extent to which attention processes in parents operate independently and interactively with intrapsychic processes, proximal interpersonal stressors, and the larger socioeconomic context to predict perceptions of parenting hassles in primarily low-income Latino/a parents of young children living in urban areas of concentrated disadvantage (N = 185). Analyses indicated that parent reports of anxiety, intimate partner violence, and perceptions of financial hardship each uniquely predicted parents' perceptions of daily parenting hassles. Parents' attentional bias toward threat interacted with anxiety symptoms such that parents experiencing high levels of attention bias toward threat in combination with high levels of anxiety reported significantly more daily parenting hassles. Findings from the current study provide insight into the ways in which neurocognitive processes affect one aspect of parenting, with implications for programs and policies designed to support parenting for families in poverty.

The results demonstrated a good fit for the sample. The overall model explained 12.7% and 16.1% of the variance for children's anxiety and depression, respectively. Poverty had a significantly direct effect on children's anxiety and depression, and family social capital could partially mediate the influence of poverty on children's internalizing symptoms.

In contrast, a social isolation perspective proposes that neighborhood stability has negative effects on residents'psychological well-being in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. This analysis of multilevel data-data in which survey information from a representative sample of Illinois residents is linked to census-tract information about poverty and stability in their neighborhoodsupports a social isolation perspective. In affluent neighborhoods, stability is associated with low levels of distress; under conditions of poverty the opposite is true. In part this occurs because residents of poor, stable neighborhoods face high levels of disorder in their neighborhoods. Stability does not reduce perceived disorder under conditions of poverty, as it does in more affluent neighborhoods, which leaves residents feeling powerless to leave a dangerous place. Finally, the negative effects of poor, stable neighborhoods on residents'psychological well-being do not stem from a lack of social ties among neighbors. N EIGHBORHOOD stability traditionally has been heralded as a boon to quality of life, but stability's influence may not always be positive. We extend the research on neighborhood stability by showing how the benefits of stability for individual psychological well-being depend on the local economic context. We make three contributions. First, we directly assess residents' psychological distress, measured as depression and anxiety. We depart from the tradition of considering crime as the ultimate outcome and instead examine the effects of neighborhood stability and poverty on the psychological well-being of residents. Second, we examine the effects of residential stability across different types of neighborhoods because the effect of neighborhood stability on psychological well-being may depend on economic context. Third, we investigate whether physical and social disorder in the neighborhood mediates the joint effect of neighborhood stability and poverty on distress because disorder influences residents' perceptions that they are powerless to leave a threatening and dangerous environment.",2000,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Anxiety,478

Functional status, sick days from work, and health-related quality of life (including a preference-based measure) were assessed using standardized measures adjusting for the impact of comorbid medical illnesses. Relative impact of the various anxiety disorders and major depression on these indices was evaluated.In multivariate regression analyses simultaneously adjusting for age, sex, number of chronic medical conditions, education, and/or poverty status, each of major depression, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and social phobia contributed independently and relatively equally to the prediction of disability and functional outcomes. Generalized anxiety disorder had relatively little impact on these indices when the effects of comorbid major depression were considered. Overall, anxiety disorders were associated with substantial decrements in preference-based health states.These observations demonstrate that the presence of each of 3 common anxiety disorders (ie, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and social phobia)-over and above the impact of chronic physical illness, major depression, and other socioeconomic factors-contributes in an approximately additive fashion to the prediction of poor functioning, reduced health-related quality of life, and more sick days from work.

Using a longitudinal psychosocial methodology, I demonstrate how poverty can be conceptualized as a threatening 'object' to volunteer tourists, inducing unconscious anxiety by challenging Western materialistic lifestyles and identities. Volunteer tourists negotiate this anxiety in three ways: by transforming poverty into a source of moral redemption; by allowing poverty to become subsumed into a seductive, exotic landscape so that it can be admired and consumed; and by constructing impoverished communities as 'poor but happy'. It is argued that these neutralizing constructions act as barriers, preventing the intimate engagement with communities that volunteer tourism promises and lessening the potential of poverty to shock, move and even change those who come into contact with it.",2012,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Anxiety,131

Methods: Data from 26 946 US past-year drinkers 18 years of age and over, interviewed in the 2001–2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), were used to construct multivariate linear regression models predicting six measures of drinking pattern and volume. Results: There was a consistent positive relationship between number of past-year stressors experienced and all measures of heavy drinking. Frequency of heavy (5+ drinks for men; 4+ drinks for women) drinking increased by 24% with each additional stressor reported by men and by 13% with each additional stressor reported by women. In contrast, the frequency of moderate drinking (<5 drinks for men; <4 drinks for women) decreased as stress levels increased. Job-related and legal sources of stress were more strongly associated with alcohol consumption than were social and health-related stress. Men showed a stronger association than women between the number of stressors and the most consumption measures; they also responded more strongly to the presence of any legal and job-related stress. Having an income below the poverty level intensified the effects of job-related stress, but having a mood or anxiety disorder did not affect any of the associations between stress and consumption. Conclusions: Stress does not so much lead individuals to drink more often as to substitute larger quantities of alcohol on the days when they do drink.

10.1136/bmj.322.7285.544,Asylum seekers and refugees in Britain: Health needs of asylum seekers and refugees,,"This is the second in a series of three articles 

People who are seeking asylum are not a homogeneous population. Coming from different countries and cultures, they have had, in their own and other countries, a wide range of experiences that may affect their health and nutritional state. In the United Kingdom they face the effects of poverty, dependence, and lack of cohesive social support.1 All these factors undermine both physical and mental health. Additionally, racial discrimination can result in inequalities in health and have an impact on opportunities in and quality of life.2

Refugees' experiences also shape their acceptance and expectations of health care in the United Kingdom.3 Those from countries with no well developed primary healthcare system may expect hospital referral for conditions that in Britain are treated in primary care. This can lead to disappointment for refugees and irritation for health workers, who may also feel overwhelmed by the many and varying needs of asylum seekers, some of which are non-medical but nevertheless affect health. Addressing even a few of these needs may be of considerable benefit.

Previous studies in the United Kingdom have found that one in six refugees has a physical health problem severe enough to affect their life and two thirds have experienced anxiety or depression. 4 5 Disentangling the web of history, symptoms—which may be minimised or exaggerated for a range of reasons—and current coping mechanisms requires patience and often several sessions. Medication should be as simple as possible.

10.1017/s2045796023000811,"Strengthening self-regulation and reducing poverty to prevent adolescent depression and anxiety: Rationale, approach and methods of the ALIVE interdisciplinary research collaboration in Colombia, Nepal and South Africa",,"Abstract Aims Depression and anxiety are the leading contributors to the global burden of disease among young people, accounting for over a third (34.8%) of years lived with disability. Yet there is limited evidence for interventions that prevent adolescent depression and anxiety in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where 90% of adolescents live. This article introduces the ‘Improving Adolescent mentaL health by reducing the Impact of poVErty (ALIVE)’ study, its conceptual framework, objectives, methods and expected outcomes. The aim of the ALIVE study is to develop and pilot-test an intervention that combines poverty reduction with strengthening self-regulation to prevent depression and anxiety among adolescents living in urban poverty in Colombia, Nepal and South Africa. Methods This aim will be achieved by addressing four objectives: (1) develop a conceptual framework that identifies the causal mechanisms linking poverty, self-regulation and depression and anxiety; (2) develop a multi-component selective prevention intervention targeting self-regulation and poverty among adolescents at high risk of developing depression or anxiety; (3) adapt and validate instruments to measure incidence of depression and anxiety, mediators and implementation parameters of the prevention intervention; and (4) undertake a four-arm pilot cluster randomised controlled trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability and cost of the selective prevention intervention in the three study sites. Results The contributions of this study include the active engagement and participation of adolescents in the research process; a focus on the causal mechanisms of the intervention; building an evidence base for prevention interventions in LMICs; and the use of an interdisciplinary approach. Conclusions By developing and evaluating an intervention that addresses multidimensional poverty and self-regulation, ALIVE can make contributions to evidence on the integration of mental health into broader development policy and practice.",2023,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Anxiety,6

Childhood mental health problems are difficult to address in situations of ongoing poverty and political instability.To assess the efficacy of a school-based intervention designed for conflict-exposed children, implemented in a low-income setting.A cluster randomized trial involving 495 children (81.4% inclusion rate) who were a mean (SD) age of 9.9 (1.3) years, were attending randomly selected schools in political violence-affected communities in Poso, Indonesia, and were screened for exposure (> or = 1 events), posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety symptoms compared with a wait-listed control group. Nonblinded assessment took place before, 1 week after, and 6 months after treatment between March and December 2006.Fifteen sessions, over 5 weeks, of a manualized, school-based group intervention, including trauma-processing activities, cooperative play, and creative-expressive elements, implemented by locally trained paraprofessionals.We assessed psychiatric symptoms using the Child Posttraumatic Stress Scale, Depression Self-Rating Scale, the Self-Report for Anxiety Related Disorders 5-item version, and the Children's Hope Scale, and assessed function impairment as treatment outcomes using standardized symptom checklists and locally developed rating scales.Correcting for clustering of participants within schools, we found significantly more improvement in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (mean change difference, 2.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02 to 4.53) and maintained hope (mean change difference, -2.21; 95% CI, -3.52 to -0.91) in the treatment group than in the wait-listed group. Changes in traumatic idioms (stress-related physical symptoms) (mean change difference, 0.50; 95% CI, -0.12 to 1.11), depressive symptoms (mean change difference, 0.70; 95% CI, -0.08 to 1.49), anxiety (mean change difference, 0.12; 95% CI, -0.31 to 0.56), and functioning (mean change difference, 0.52; 95% CI, -0.43 to 1.46) were not different between the treatment and wait-listed groups.In this study of children in violence-affected communities, a school-based intervention reduced posttraumatic stress symptoms and helped maintain hope, but did not reduce traumatic-stress related symptoms, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, or functional impairment.isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN25172408.",2008,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Anxiety,264

In high- and low-income countries, prior evidence linking maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms with infant LBW is conflicting. There is no research on the association between maternal mental disorders and LBW in Bangladesh. This study aims to investigate the independent effect of maternal antepartum depressive and anxiety symptoms on infant LBW among women in a rural district of Bangladesh. A population-based sample of 720 pregnant women from two rural subdistricts was assessed for symptoms of antepartum depression, using the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), and antepartum anxiety, using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and followed for 6-8 months postpartum. Infant birth weight of 583 (81%) singleton live babies born at term (≥37 weeks of pregnancy) was measured within 48 hours of delivery. Baseline data provided socioeconomic, anthropometric, reproductive, obstetric, and social support information. Trained female interviewers carried out structured interviews. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and independent-sample t tests were done as descriptive statistics, and a multiple logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of LBW. After adjusting for potential confounders, depressive (OR = 2.24; 95% CI 1.37-3.68) and anxiety (OR = 2.08; 95% CI 1.30-3.25) symptoms were significantly associated with LBW (≤2.5 kg). Poverty, maternal malnutrition, and support during pregnancy were also associated with LBW. This study provides evidence that maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy predict the LBW of newborns and replicates results found in other South Asian countries. Policies aimed at the detection and effective management of depressive and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy may reduce the burden on mothers and also act as an important measure in the prevention of LBW among offspring in Bangladesh.",2010,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Anxiety,170
10.2307/1602779,Prevalence and Effects of Child Exposure to Domestic Violence,,"In recent years, researchers have focused attention on children who are exposed to domestic violence. Although presently there are no scientifically credible estimates of the national prevalence of children exposed to domestic violence, existing data suggest that large numbers of American children are affected. This article discusses the limitations of current databases and describes a promising model for the collection of reliable and valid prevalence data, the Spousal Assault Replication Program, which uses data collected through collaboration between police and university researchers. Research examining the effects of childhood exposure to domestic violence is also limited by a range of methodological problems. Despite this, however, sufficient evidence from the body of studies exists to conclude that such exposure has adverse effects. The specific effects may differ depending on a host of variables, such as the children's ages, the nature and severity of the violence, the existence of other risk factors in the children's lives (for example, poverty, parental substance abuse), and whether the children are also directly physically abused. In general, childhood exposure to domestic violence can be associated with increased display of aggressive behavior, increased emotional problems such as depression and/or anxiety, lower levels of social competence, and poorer academic functioning. A scientifically credible body of research on the prevalence and effects of childhood exposure to domestic violence is necessary to promote the development of effective interventions and to permit the proper channeling of public and private funds. This article identifies some of the steps that can be taken to build the research capacity necessary to obtain the needed data.",1999,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Anxiety,364

A family stress model was examined using data from 1,142 mothers living in 2 areas of high rural poverty, focusing on the infancy through toddlerhood period. Maternal questionnaires and observations of mother-child interactions were collected across 4 time points (6, 15, 24, and 36 months). Results from structural equation analyses indicated that early economic pressure was significantly related to a variety of symptoms (depression, hostility, anxiety, and somatization), but only depression and somatization were significantly related to decreased levels of sensitive, supportive parenting behaviors. In contrast, anxiety was positively associated with sensitive parenting. Depression and anxiety were both found to mediate the relations between economic pressure and sensitive parenting behaviors. Results further suggest that mothers did not experience change in objective economic hardship over time but did experience a small decrease in economic pressure. Discussion centers on the apparent indirect influence of early economic hardship on later psychological symptoms and parenting behaviors, as well as detailing the need for broader and more complex perspectives on maternal psychological responses that arise as a result of economic disadvantage.",2013,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Anxiety,186

10.1002/ajpa.20724,Seasonal changes in household food insecurity and symptoms of anxiety and depression,,"There is growing awareness that common mental health disorders are key contributors to the burden of disease in developing countries. Studies examining the correlates of mental health have primarily been carried out in urban settings and focused on the burden rapid economic change places on individuals. In these settings, poverty and low education are consistent predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms. We argue here that these variables are proxies for insecurity, and that a more general model of symptoms of depression and anxiety should focus on locally salient forms of insecurity. Building on previous work in a seasonal subsistence setting, we identify food insecurity as a potent source of insecurity in a rural African setting, and then test whether seasonal changes in food insecurity are correlated with concomitant changes in a measure of symptoms of anxiety and depression among 173 caretakers. Results indicate that food insecurity is a strong predictor of symptoms of anxiety and depression (P < 0.0001), that changes in food insecurity across the seasons predict changes in symptoms of anxiety and depression (P < 0.0001), and that this is robust to the inclusion of covariates for material assets and household production. These results hold for individuals in both ethnic groups studied (Pimbwe and Sukuma); however, at the group level the burden falls disproportionately on Pimbwe. The results add to the growing literature on the causes of population level differences in mental health disorders and suggest new research avenues and strategies to link mental health disorders with variation in physical and biosocial outcomes.",2007,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Anxiety,129

Maternal and child mental health are intimately intertwined; thus, the distress of both is likely to continue if the mother's needs are unaddressed. Because mothers overcome numerous instrumental challenges to help their children, the authors identify potential perceptual barriers to mothers' help seeking. An ethnographic analysis of in-depth qualitative interviews with 127 distressed mothers suggests several critical perceptual factors. For example, mothers attributed their distress to external causes (e.g., poverty, negative life stressors), which they believed individually focused mental health services could not affect. Interviewees also anticipated negative ramifications for seeking care, including being labeled unfit mothers, and thus potentially losing custody of their children. The authors discuss the implications of these and other key themes for engaging lower income mothers and their children.",2006,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Anxiety,175

Prior research on self-reported distress among inner-city minority children is replicated and extended among low-income, rural White children with evidence of higher levels of self- and parent-reported psychological distress, greater difficulties in self-regulatory behavior (delayed gratification), and elevated psychophysiological stress (resting blood pressure, overnight neuroendocrine hormones).

Most explanatory work on the underlying psychological processes of how poverty affects development has focused on parental investment and parenting practices, principally responsiveness. Our primary objective in this article was to describe a third, complementary pathway—chronic stress and coping—that may also prove helpful in understanding the developmental impacts of early childhood poverty throughout life. Disadvantaged children are more likely than their wealthier peers to confront a wide array of physical stressors (e.g., substandard housing, chaotic environments) and psychosocial stressors (e.g., family turmoil, separation from adult caregivers). As exposure to stressors accumulates, physiological response systems that are designed to handle relatively infrequent, acute environmental demands are overwhelmed.

Path analyses with a multiethnic sample of 164 children aged 6 to 18 revealed that the stress associated with poverty, such as economic strain, family conflict, violence/trauma, and discrimination, is an important component of the experience of poverty for children. Poverty-related stress was associated with a wide range of correlates, including internalizing and externalizing syndromes, DSM-IV diagnostic symptoms, physical health, and deviant behavior such as pregnancy, legal problems, substance abuse, and school dropout. Most models fit equally well for adolescents and preadolescents, suggesting that poverty is stressful for children as young as 6.

Exposure to chronic stressors may be one underlying mechanism for childhood poverty-health relations by influencing emotion regulatory systems. Animal work and human cross-sectional studies both suggest that chronic stressor exposure is associated with amygdala and prefrontal cortex regions important for emotion regulation. In this longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging study of 49 participants, we examined associations between childhood poverty at age 9 and adult neural circuitry activation during emotion regulation at age 24. To test developmental timing, concurrent, adult income was included as a covariate. Adults with lower family income at age 9 exhibited reduced ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity and failure to suppress amygdala activation during effortful regulation of negative emotion at age 24. In contrast to childhood income, concurrent adult income was not associated with neural activity during emotion regulation. Furthermore, chronic stressor exposure across childhood (at age 9, 13, and 17) mediated the relations between family income at age 9 and ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity at age 24.

This model (Wadsworth, Raviv, Santiago, & Etter, 2011 ) builds on Conger and Elder's family stress model by proposing that primary control coping and secondary control coping can help reduce the negative effects of economic strain on parental behaviors central to the family stress model, namely, parental depressive symptoms and parent-child interactions, which together can decrease child internalizing and externalizing problems. Two hundred seventy-five co-parenting couples with children between the ages of 1 and 18 participated in an evaluation of a brief family strengthening intervention, aimed at preventing economic strain's negative cascade of influence on parents, and ultimately their children. The longitudinal path model, analyzed at the couple dyad level with mothers and fathers nested within couple, showed very good fit, and was not moderated by child gender or ethnicity. Analyses revealed direct positive effects of primary control coping and secondary control coping on mothers' and fathers' depressive symptoms. Decreased economic strain predicted more positive father-child interactions, whereas increased secondary control coping predicted less negative mother-child interactions. Positive parent-child interactions, along with decreased parent depression and economic strain, predicted child internalizing and externalizing over the course of 18 months. Multiple-group models analyzed separately by parent gender revealed, however, that child age moderated father effects. Findings provide support for the adaptation to poverty-related stress model and suggest that prevention and clinical interventions for families affected by poverty-related stress may be strengthened by including modules that address economic strain and efficacious strategies for coping with strain.",2013,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Stress,69

Toxic stress—the results of exposure to adverse childhood experiences—results in changes to brain structure and function that negatively affects future health. Objectives The aim of this study was to apply the eco-bio-developmental (EBD) model of poverty and preterm birth to the cross-sectional data of the 2016 National Survey of Children’s Health to evaluate the associations between poverty, toxic stress, and prematurity on neurodevelopmental and educational outcomes. Methods A subset of data representing children ages 6–11 years old ( n = 15,010) from the 2016 National Survey of Children’s Health was used for multivariate analysis of demographic variables and neurodevelopmental and educational outcome variables. Pearson’s chi-square, logistic regression, and interaction effects explored the relationships between prematurity, toxic stress, and poverty. Results Children in this sample born preterm had a higher incidence of toxic stress, poverty, developmental delay, learning disability, intellectual disability, speech/language disorders, attention-deficit disorder (ADD)/attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, and special education/early intervention plans. The combination of poverty, toxic stress, and preterm birth significantly increased the risk of these conditions. After accounting for gender, insurance coverage, race, and parental education, children in the sample born preterm were more likely to experience developmental delay, intellectual disability, speech/language disorder, learning disability, and ADD/ADHD. Toxic stress increased the incidence of ADD/ADHD and autism in both the preterm and full-term samples.

Currently, there are no studies on the association between ACEs and adults' subjective experiences of stress in the parenting role, where socioeconomic status (SES)−related poverty effects have been controlled for--the central question behind the current study. We examined exposure to ACEs among 118 mothers (n = 33 low SES/impoverished and n = 85 middle/high SES) and parenting distress. Participants completed an ACE questionnaire that assessed exposure to 10 adverse experiences from childhood (e.g., abuse, neglect, household dysfunction), and the Parenting Stress Index−Short Form. Parenting distress and ACEs were significantly higher in the low SES group; yet, even after controlling for SES, higher ACE scores added significant explained variance in parental distress in a linear regression model. DISCUSSION focuses on the need to administer ACE screening in prenatal and pediatric settings to identify and to offer trauma- and attachment-informed treatment, so to reduce the intergenerational transmission of risk associated with problematic parenting.

Multilevel modeling showed a positive within‐persons relationship between daily stress and coping, and a positive between‐persons relationship between daily stress and child learned helplessness. Implications include understanding the daily processes through which the poverty ecology transmits risk for negative child developmental outcomes and through which parents might offer protection. Specifically, the results suggest that daily poverty‐related stressors may undermine young children's developing sense of control and suggest the importance of further research on how parent coping might promote positive outcomes.",2016,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Stress,19
10.1002/imhj.20044,Efficacy and social support as predictors of parenting stress among families in poverty,,"Using a sample of low-income mothers enrolled in Early Head Start (n = 65), this study tested the hypothesis that parenting stress is affected by social support and self-efficacy, in addition to family risk status and family income. Specifically, it was proposed that social support and self-efficacy are psychological resources that are associated with lower parenting stress levels, and would moderate the impact of family income on parenting stress. A significant proportion of variance in parenting stress was explained by self-efficacy, family risk, and the interaction of self-efficacy and family income; family income alone was not a significant predictor of parenting stress levels. Mothers higher in self-efficacy had lower levels of parenting stress, and income was less associated with parenting stress levels for mothers high in self-efficacy. Social support was not associated with lower parenting stress levels, nor did social support moderate the effect of income on parenting stress. Family risk was also a strong and reliable predictor of parenting stress, suggesting that family circumstances are perhaps better predictors of parenting stress levels than income alone. These findings suggest that parenting stress among low-income parents should be viewed as a function of psychological, as well as financial, resources.",2005,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Stress,296
10.1111/1467-9566.13084,The violence of narrative: embodying responsibility for poverty‐related stress,,"Abstract Narratives of self‐responsibility are pervasive in neoliberally oriented contexts, and have been found to engender feelings of shame and failure amongst those affected by poverty. Here, we use findings from research in two low‐income communities in south‐west England to examine how these narratives become embodied within people's daily lives when they intersect with systems of welfare support and the current political drive to upscale treatment for common mental health conditions. Drawing on Bourdieu's notion of symbolic violence, we examine how narratives of self‐responsibility and associated welfare reform strategies impact on the mental health of people living in economic hardship. The data show how such narratives inflict, sustain and exacerbate mental distress and suffering, and how they become naturalised and normalised by individuals themselves. We demonstrate how this situation pushes people to seek support from General Practitioners, and how clinical interactions can normalise, and in turn, medicalise, poverty‐related distress. Whilst some people actively resist dominant narratives around self‐responsibility, we argue that this is insufficient under broader sociocultural and political circumstances, to free themselves from the harms perpetuated by symbolic violence.",2020,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Stress,21

Multigroup path analysis tested moderation by gender and race/ethnicity.Path analysis revealed that PRS was indirectly associated with higher depressive symptoms through less social support and less use of engagement coping operating in parallel and sequentially in a three-path mediated sequence. Conversely, EI was indirectly associated with lower depressive symptoms through greater social support and greater use of engagement coping operating in parallel and sequentially. However, PRS remained a direct predictor of higher depressive symptoms. Moderation by gender and race/ethnicity was not found.Overall, the findings provide empirical support for the APRS model. This study suggests that clinical and preventive interventions targeting depression in low-income parents could benefit from focusing on improving low-income parent's use of engagement coping and perceived social support. Ethnic identity is a promising target as it to protects against PRS' negative impact on coping and social support.

However, these studies are confined largely to middle‐class and general populations. We extend what is known by examining how the unique stressors and forms of social support experienced by women in poverty impact alcohol problems over a 4‐year time‐period. Design, setting and participants This prospective study used generalized estimating equations (GEE) transition modeling and four annual waves of survey data from 392 American mothers receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) in a large Northern California county. Measurements We examined the effects of neighborhood disorder, stressful life events and economic hardship on psychological distress and problem drinking over time, and whether social support moderated these relationships for women in poverty. Findings Neighborhood disorder and stressful life events increased significantly the risk for problem drinking, largely through their effect on psychological distress. We found little evidence, however, that social support buffers poor women from the effects of these stressors. Conclusions Women in poverty are exposed to severe, chronic stressors within their communities and immediate social networks which increase vulnerability to psychological distress and problem drinking. The finding that social support does not buffer stress among these women may reflect their high level of exposure to stressors, as well as the hardships and scarce resources within their networks. If the ‘private safety net’ of the social network fails to provide a strong buffer, more effective environmental interventions that reduce exposure to stressors may be needed to prevent alcohol problems in poor women's lives.",2008,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Stress,139

Emotional distress is among the more common factors associated with HIV treatment adherence. Typical barriers to adherence may be overshadowed by poverty experiences in the most disadvantaged populations of people living with HIV/AIDS, such as people with lower-literacy skills. Methods: One hundred eighty-eight men and women living with HIV/AIDS who demonstrated poor health literacy completed measures of social and health-related stress, indicators of extreme poverty, as well as other factors associated with nonadherence. HIV treatment adherence was monitored prospectively, using unannounced pill counts. Results: Two-thirds of the sample demonstrated adherence <85% of pills taken. Multivariable analyses showed that food insufficiency and hunger predicted antiretroviral therapy nonadherence over and above depression, internalized stigma, substance use, and HIV-related social stressors. Conclusions: Interventions for HIV treatment nonadherence with the most socially disadvantaged persons in developed countries should be reconceptualized to directly address poverty, especially food insufficiency and hunger, as both a moral and public health imperative.

Cumulative risk exposure was measured by multiple physical (e.g., substandard housing) and social (e.g., family turmoil) risk factors. The greater the number of years spent living in poverty, the more elevated was overnight cortisol and the more dysregulated was the cardiovascular response (i.e., muted reactivity).

In a large nationally representative U.S. sample (N = 1,519), we examined the association between social class (household income) and self-reported tendencies to experience 7 distinct positive emotions that are core to happiness: amusement, awe, compassion, contentment, enthusiasm, love, and pride. Consistent with past research indicating that social class underlies differential patterns of attending to the self versus orienting to others, higher social class was associated with greater self-oriented feelings of contentment and pride, and with greater amusement. In contrast, lower social class was associated with more other-oriented feelings of compassion and love, and with greater awe. There were no class differences in enthusiasm. We discuss that individuals from different social class backgrounds may exhibit different patterns of emotional responding due to their distinct social concerns and priorities. Whereas self-oriented emotions may follow from, foster, and reinforce upper class individuals' desire for independence and self-sufficiency, greater other-oriented emotion may enable lower class individuals to form more interdependent bonds to cope with their more threatening environments.

Only 16% of the participants reported being happy. Participants said that when basic needs are not satisfied happiness is impossible. Overall, satisfaction with life in specific domains was higher because of satisfaction in nonmaterial domains. The main criteria for happiness were having basic living conditions, a job, and positive relationships with family and neighbors. After survival needs were met, social, spiritual, and personal aspects of life became important for subjective well-being. Satisfaction with income was correlated with comparative income and not with objective income.

The survey revealed that flooded farmers were amongst the poorest in the study system. Seven variables determined poverty in this study: household size, location, the percentage of the farm size that was flooded, fishing, the farmer’s gender, farm size, and “holding a secondary activity”. Regarding happiness, 99% of the flooded farmers were unhappier after the flood in 2012. The results clearly show that being subjected to floods increases the incidence of poverty.

In the second section, ""liberalism, poverty and welfare in the U.S.,"" I will juxtapose the Catholic approach with what is arguably the dominate orientation toward the human person and his or her relationship to property and wealth in the United States of America as derived from a certain brand of liberalism. In the third section, ""poverty, religion and human rights in the U.S.,"" I will try to make the case in the context of the history of the American welfare state and recent developments in the area of welfare reform, that the current consensus and mode of discourse surrounding poverty and welfare in the United States stands in direct opposition to the most fundamental aspects of Christianity in general and the social teachings of Catholicism in particular. More specifically, I will argue that the contemporary approach to poverty and welfare engendered in legislation like Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF) and the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) represent at their root a fundamental violation of the most basic of all God-given human rights, namely to give one's self in agapic love to the Other. If that argument is made successfully, the implication regarding the approach to welfare in the United States will be that the public policy that sustains such a violation it is at least partially reflective of what is now called a structure of sin.

Whereas the vast income disparity between urban and rural households is confirmed, it is found that, remarkably, rural households report higher subjective well-being than do their richer urban counterparts. A decomposition analysis explores the reasons for this reversal. It finds that there are many determinants of happiness other than absolute income, and that the determinants differ in the two sectors. An explanation for the puzzle is advanced in terms of relative concepts, income inequalities, orbits of comparison, and degrees of insecurity. Positive and normative implications are discussed.

This study finds that poverty entry means a transition from a situation where individuals have sufficient income to support their living standard to a situation of insufficient income. Thus, both financial satisfaction (FS) and life satisfaction (LS) significantly decrease. In the long run, those who remain in poverty are trapped in the situation of insufficient income. Both FS and LS thus have limited, if any, adaptation. Implications are discussed for economics and psychology theories and policies.",2019,Openalex,Affective,Poverty and Happiness,1

Explanations given for why there are poor people in America may reveal much about underlying structured inequality legitimating mechanisms. Using multiple regression, one-way ANOVA, and frequency distribution analyses, I uncover a conservative-liberal continuum underlying American poverty cause attributions. Past explanations for the mostly mixed nature of American attributions toward poverty are questioned. I suggest a more simple and straightforward explanation: mixed attribution styles, situated on a conservative-liberal continuum, may arise from American's distinguishing between at least two groups of poor people—""deserving"" and ""undeserving""—suggesting policy and future research agendas.

Drawing from cognitive dissonance theory, it was argued that adherents of the Just World Belief redefine and reinterpret perceived inequalities in order to reduce or eliminate the contradiction between the two cognitions. Using data from a probability sample of adults, six hypotheses were formally stated and empirically tested. All six were supported. The greater the acceptance of the Just World Belief, the greater the likelihood of perceiving inequalities as fair, inevitable, and immutable. Also, the belief was positively related to the odds of derogating the poor, praising the wealthy, and favoring individualistic explanations of inequalities over structural ones. Lastly, the Just World Belief was inversely related to the likelihood of perceiving inequalities as extensive.

Lay explanations for “wealth” have been neglected in research on beliefs about social stratification. This study compares the nature and determinants of beliefs about the causes of both wealth and poverty, with special focus on race/ethnic differences. Methods. Using survey data collected from Los Angeles County residents in 2000, descriptive and multivariate procedures are used to analyze “individualistic” and “structuralist” beliefs about wealth and poverty. In addition, one “fatalistic” belief, asking about the role of “God's will” in shaping wealth and poverty, is examined. Analyses test (1) whether race/ethnicity and other social and political characteristics variables shape these stratification beliefs, and (2) whether African Americans, Latinos, and whites differ in the determinants of beliefs about wealth and poverty. Results. Respondents favor individualistic over structuralist reasons for wealth, but favor structuralist over individualistic beliefs in explaining poverty. Fatalistic beliefs are least popular. On beliefs about wealth, African Americans, Latinos, and whites show similar levels of support for individualistic explanations; however, the race/ethnic minorities are both more structuralist than whites on this issue. On beliefs about poverty, the race/ethnic minorities are simultaneously more structuralist and more individualistic than are whites. Social‐class identification and self‐reported conservatism both significantly impact beliefs about wealth and poverty, and do so differently across race/ethnic lines. Conclusions. Findings support the separate treatment and examination of beliefs about wealth and poverty, and reinforce recent calls for greater attention to “nonwhites” in studies of sociopolitical attitudes.",2004,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Beliefs,141

This study examines the relationship between religious affiliation and “individualistic,”“structuralist,” and “fatalistic” beliefs about the causes of poverty, and compares the beliefs of African Americans, Latinos, and whites. Methods . Survey data collected in 1993 from a sample of southern Californians are used to test whether several religious affiliations (Protestant, Catholic, Jew, “other religion,” and nonaffiliation) shape beliefs about poverty after controlling for race/ethnicity, SES, gender, and age. In addition, the question of whether African Americans, Latinos, and whites differ in the effects of key religious affiliations is examined. Results . Significant religious affiliation effects are found, net of sociodemographic controls. Protestants and Catholics are strongest on individualistic beliefs; Jews and followers of “other” religions are strongest on structuralist beliefs; Catholics and Jews are strongest on fatalistic beliefs. Finally, race/ethnic differences are found for the effects of key religious affiliations. Conclusion .

Findings indicate that the incidence and determinants of causal beliefs are more complex than has been reached in prior “generic” poverty research and the findings provide greater support for the public arenas theory. Three findings are of particular note: (1) sample respondents have distinctive causal beliefs for different types of poverty: for welfare dependency, individualistic beliefs are dominant; for homelessness, structural causes are emphasized; a causal “middle ground” is most popular for impoverished migrant laborers (2) status characteristics do not operate as determinants of causal beliefs in a straightforward fashion for any of the three poverty types and, (3) variables that measure types of exposure to, and perceived racial composition of, the poor are also significant determinants of causal beliefs. The effects of variables that measure perceived racial composition are particularly strong and the pattern of “color coding” suggests that racial prejudice shapes causal beliefs about the plight of the poor.

Second, it tests a block variable regression model of popular support for the various belief sets to determine how deeply Americans divide along traditional ideological lines. This model includes not only objective status and demographic factors but subjective variables as well. The results indicate only shallow cleavages in beliefs about poverty and account for why previous studies found deeper ones. Support for the institutional discrimination position is especially broad and is independent of support for individualistic or structural beliefs.

Using data from two Los Angeles County surveys and the 1990 Census, multi-level linear and logistic regression models reveal that higher levels of concentrated disadvantage are associated with increased support for both individualist and structuralist explanations of poverty—a “dual consciousness” pattern the authors attribute to increased exposure to social conditions that simultaneously foster sympathetic and antagonistic attitudes toward the poor.

However, only a small body of research has focused on Black and Latinx adolescents' developing beliefs about the causes of poverty or the relationship between such beliefs and their awareness of racism. The present study sought to contribute to this scholarship with a longitudinal investigation involving Black and Latinx adolescents (n = 457) attending urban secondary schools in 5 northeastern cities. Specifically, we investigated (a) these adolescents' change over time in their beliefs about the causes of poverty; (b) the relationship between their developing beliefs about the causes of poverty and changes in their awareness of racism; and (c) the role of a progressive schooling experience in influencing the adolescents' beliefs about the causes of poverty. Multivariate latent growth modeling revealed that participants demonstrated significant positive change over time in their conception of poverty as caused by structural factors as well as a significant relationship at each time point between adolescents' beliefs about the causes of poverty and awareness of interpersonal racism. However, we found that attending a secondary school featuring a progressive schooling model did not significantly predict adolescents' change in beliefs about the structural causes of poverty.

This paper examines baccalaureate nursing students’ beliefs about the relationship between poverty and health, and the factors that influence these beliefs. Background. The relationship between poverty and health is well established, and poverty remains a persistent problem in many industrialized nations. Nurses’ understanding of how poverty influences health will affect how they interact with individual clients as well as the strategies they employ to address poverty‐related issues. No studies have examined nursing students’ understandings of how poverty influences health and the factors that influence that understanding. Methods. A cross‐sectional survey of a random sample ( n = 740) of basic baccalaureate nursing students was conducted in three Canadian universities in 2000. Students completed a 59‐item questionnaire eliciting data on demographic variables, personal and educational exposure to poverty, beliefs about the relationship between poverty and health (myth, drift, behavioural, structural), and attitudes to poverty. Results. Students were most likely to adhere to a structural explanation of the relationship between poverty and health. Very little of the variance in myth and drift explanations was accounted for by course or personal exposure, programme level, age, and attitudes toward poverty. Greater course exposure and more positive attitudes toward the poor predicted support for the structural explanation. Support for the behavioural explanation was influenced by attitudes toward the poor and, to a lesser extent, by course exposure, age, and programme level. Conclusion. Students would benefit from greater exposure to poverty through coursework that emphasizes the structural factors contributing to poverty and its negative health consequences. Classroom experience should be complemented with clinical placements that provide students with opportunities to interact with families living in poverty and to work collaboratively with others to address the causes and consequences of poverty at community and policy levels.",2004,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Beliefs,35

These past studies have uncovered demographic characteristics associated with individualist and structuralist explanations for poverty. In the current study, we will argue that Americans, like social scientists, envision poverty as a heterogeneous and complex phenomenon. We utilize a cultural cognition theoretical approach to conceptualize these understandings of poverty as schemas. We contend that a schema of poverty contains a set of unique associations regarding both demographic beliefs (who the poor are) and causal attributions (why they are poor). Using original data in a mixed-methods design that incorporates inductive and experimental components, we find that people differentiate between two key types of poverty: intergenerational poverty and downward mobility. People perceive each type of poverty as caused by a different set of factors and as experienced by a different group of people. The type of poverty envisioned is, in most cases, as important as or more important than a respondent’s own demographic characteristics in predicting what type of causal attributions he or she makes for poverty. These findings underscore the importance of investigating different schemas of poverty in future stratification beliefs research.",2017,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Beliefs,30

The purpose of this paper is to fill that gap in the existing literature. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses the secondary analysis of a recent cross‐sectional multinational survey to shed light on public beliefs of the causes of poverty in seven countries of the region – Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. In addition, Russia and Ukraine are used as a comparison point. The theoretical framework for this study is that the subjective beliefs regarding the explanations of poverty can be classified into three broad groups: individualistic, fatalistic, and structural. Hence, regression coefficients and marginal effects of the multinomial logit regression model (MNLM) are estimated to associate the set of various individual, households, and community characteristics selected in the conceptual framework with the likelihood of choosing one of the three afore‐mentioned explanations of poverty. Findings The results of cross‐tabulation reveal that in a majority of the countries studied, the predominant explanation for poverty is structural, with the exception of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, where predominant explanations are, respectively, fatalistic and individualistic. The results of MNLM show that most individual, household, and community characteristics possess the expected direction and are in line with previous findings. However, some of the characteristics have a similar significant effect across several countries, while other characteristics are significant for a single country only. Social implications These findings demonstrate that despite the dominant post‐socialist ideology which favors individualistic and fatalistic explanations of poverty based on the economic rationality of market capitalism, the efforts of the elites in promoting and imposing these ideologies has not been fully successful. Nevertheless, no single unified model of the determinants of beliefs regarding the causes of poverty in the countries of the region is observed.

I will argue that the populist wave is challenging the sources of existing well-being in both the less-dynamic and the more prosperous areas and that better, rather than more, place-sensitive territorial development policies are needed in order to find a solution to the problem.

Drawing on research about attributions of poverty, subjective well-being, and relative income, this experimental study assesses the effects of an online poverty simulation (entitled Spent) on participants’ beliefs, attitudes, and actions. Results show that, compared with a control group, Spent players donated marginally more money to a charity serving the poor and expressed higher support for policies benefitting the poor, but were less likely to take immediate political action by signing an online petition to support a higher minimum wage. Spent players also expressed greater subjective well-being than the control group, but this was not associated with increased policy support or donations. Spent players who experienced greater presence (perceived realism of the simulation) had higher levels of empathy, which contributed to attributing poverty to structural causes and support for anti-poverty policies. We draw conclusions for theory about the psychological experience of playing online poverty simulations, and for how they could be designed to stimulate charity and support for anti-poverty policies.",2019,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Beliefs,14

The sample consisted of 1,294 participants (656 females) between the ages of 18 to 64 (Mage = 38.44, SD = 14.71), randomly selected from seven different cities in Chile. Even after controlling for gender, age, and the socioeconomic status of participants, results mainly support the role of giving behaviors as drivers of actual engagement in civic life.

We assessed the effect of this interactive, interprofessional, community-based educational experience on students’ attitudes and beliefs about poverty and health.Methods and Findings: Participants (N = 119) completed two measures at the beginning and end of the five-week project: the 37-item Attitudes toward Poverty Scale (APS) and the 8-item Beliefs about the Relationship between Poverty and Health (BRPH). APS scores showed a modest significant increase toward more positive attitudes over time (F(1, 110) = 7.97, p &lt; .01). On the BRPH, participants agreed significantly less at Week 5 with two behavioral explanations (F(1, 114) = 5.07, p &lt; .05; F(1, 114) = 11.00, p &lt; .01) and one structural explanation (F(1, 112) = 11.09, p &lt; .01) about relationships between poverty and health. There was some evidence that face-to-face interactions with community members had more impact than a simulation exercise.

In Experiment 1, student subjects rated 13 causes of poverty on importance, the attribution of controllability, blame, affects of pity and anger, and judgments of help‐giving (personal help and welfare). Two individual differences, conservatism and the belief in a just world, were also assessed. A principal components analysis categorized the causes into three types: individualistic, societal, and fatalistic. Conservatism correlated positively with a belief in the importance of individualistic causes, controllability, blame, and anger, and it correlated negatively with perceptions of the importance of societal causes, pity, and intentions to help. No systematic effects of the belief in a just world emerged. A structural equation analysis revealed that personal help is emotionally determined, whereas welfare judgments are directly related to attributions of responsibility and political ideology.

10.1186/1472-698x-9-5,Stakeholder perceptions of mental health stigma and poverty in Uganda,,"World wide, there is plentiful evidence regarding the role of stigma in mental illness, as well as the association between poverty and mental illness. The experiences of stigma catalyzed by poverty revolve around experiences of devaluation, exclusion, and disadvantage. Although the relationship between poverty, stigma and mental illness has been documented in high income countries, little has been written on this relationship in low and middle income countries.The paper describes the opinions of a range of mental health stakeholders regarding poverty, stigma, mental illness and their relationship in the Ugandan context, as part of a wider study, aimed at exploring policy interventions required to address the vicious cycle of mental ill-health and poverty.Semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with purposefully selected mental health stakeholders from various sectors. The interviews and FGDs were audio-recorded, and transcriptions were coded on the basis of a pre-determined coding frame. Thematic analysis of the data was conducted using NVivo7, adopting a framework analysis approach.Most participants identified a reciprocal relationship between poverty and mental illness. The stigma attached to mental illness was perceived as a common phenomenon, mostly associated with local belief systems regarding the causes of mental illness. Stigma associated with both poverty and mental illness serves to reinforce the vicious cycle of poverty and mental ill-health. Most participants emphasized a relationship between poverty and internalized stigma among people with mental illness in Uganda.According to a range of mental health stakeholders in Uganda, there is a strong interrelationship between poverty, stigma and mental illness. These findings re-affirm the need to recognize material resources as a central element in the fight against stigma of mental illness, and the importance of stigma reduction programmes in protecting the mentally ill from social isolation, particularly in conditions of poverty.",2009,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Internalized stigma,95

Based upon interviews with 36 women conducted in 1997, one year after the passage of the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, the paper compares women living in concentrated poverty in the inner cities with those living in rural and suburban communities. The levels of stigma vary dramatically between the two areas, with women in mixed class communities experiencing much more negative treatment and internalizing the punitive welfare discourse to a far greater extent. Women experiencing lower levels of welfare stigma are able to enact more resistive practices to counter the effects of the dominant discourse.",2004,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Internalized stigma,52

As a result, perinatally infected youth are increasingly able to reach adolescence. There is limited information about the psychosocial challenges facing adolescents living with HIV (ALWH) in rural settings of sub-Saharan Africa. We sought to understand psychosocial challenges facing ALWH in rural Uganda and their effects on mental health and HIV treatment outcomes. We conducted 5 focus group discussions and 40 one-on-one in-depth interviews in Mbarara, Uganda with adolescents (aged 13–17 years) and adult women caregivers. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed directly into English, and coded using thematic analysis to identify themes related to psychosocial adversities and mental health. Adversities faced by adolescents included negative community perceptions (perceived aggression, presumed early mortality), HIV stigma (enacted and internalized), vulnerability factors (loss of parents, poverty), and health challenges (depression, ART non-adherence). In the conceptual model that emerged from the findings, negative community perceptions (about perceived aggression or presumed early mortality) predisposed ALWH to experience enactments and internalization of stigma that led to depression and ART non-adherence. The data also identified several protective factors, including counselling, family and religious support, and timely serostatus disclosure. Interventions to correct community misperceptions about HIV can potentially reduce stigma and thereby improve physical and mental health outcomes of ALWH.",2019,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Internalized stigma,62

We sought to deepen understanding of the barriers to care engagement at three critical steps of the care cascade proposed to make greatest impact for attaining the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets aimed at shutting down the HIV epidemic. Methods Analyses were conducted among HIV-infected adults in rural East Africa. Qualitative data were collected using in-depth interviews among 63 individuals participating in an ongoing test-and treat trial (NCT01864683) in its baseline year (July 2013-June 2014). Audio recordings were transcribed, translated into English, and coded using Atlas.ti software. Data were analyzed using a thematic framework for explaining barriers to care engagement that drew upon both theory and prior empirical research in similar settings. Results Multiple barriers to engagement in care were observed. HIV-related stigma across dimensions of anticipated, internalized and enacted stigma manifested in denial and fears of disclosure, and influenced lapses in care engagement across multiple steps in the cascade. Poverty (lack of food and transport), lack of social support, work interference, prior negative experiences with health services, drug side effects, and treatment fatigue also negatively affected ART adherence and viral suppression. Gender differences were observed, with work interference and denial disproportionately affecting men compared to women. Conclusion Multiple barriers to HIV care engagement still pervade rural sub-Saharan settings threatening the realization of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. To control the epidemic, efforts need to be accelerated to combat stigma. Patient economic empowerment, innovative drug formulations, as well as more patient-responsive health systems, may help overcome barriers to engagement in care.",2018,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Internalized stigma,64

Reflected appraisals and social rejection, in turn, reinforce delinquency. In the context of severely disadvantaged inner‐city communities—where arrests have become a normal and expected ritual of male adolescence, and official labelers and labels have less legitimacy—the alleged preconditions for a “labeling” effect of an arrest are generally not met. Retrospective, personal interviews with 20 minority youth (aged 18–20) from high‐poverty urban neighborhoods, who experienced at least one juvenile arrest, suggest that juvenile arrests typically carry little stigma and do little discernible harm to self‐concept or social relationships. Micro‐level labeling theory is an inadequate framework to understand the social impact of mass criminal justice intervention in inner‐city communities. Whereas the individual social psychological impact of the official labeling process has weakened, the mass criminalization of inner‐city African‐American youth has exacted collective costs in terms of social exclusion and diminished social expectations.",2008,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Internalized stigma,62

In Latin America and the Caribbean, structural factors such as poverty, stigma, and inequality disproportionately affect women and may fuel both the HIV epidemic and food insecurity. Methods We examined factors contributing to food insecurity among women living with HIV (WLHIV) in the Dominican Republic (DR). Data collection included in-depth, semi-structured interviews in 2013 with 30 WLHIV with indications of food insecurity who resided in urban or peri-urban areas and were recruited from local HIV clinics. In-person interviews were conducted in Spanish. Transcripts were coded using content analysis methods and an inductive approach to identify principal and emergent themes. Results Respondents identified economic instability as the primary driver of food insecurity, precipitated by enacted stigma in the labor and social domains. Women described experiences of HIV-related labor discrimination in formal and informal sectors. Women commonly reported illegal HIV testing by employers, and subsequent dismissal if HIV-positive, especially in tourism and free trade zones. Enacted stigma in the social domain manifested as gossip and rejection by family, friends, and neighbors and physical, verbal, and sexual abuse by intimate partners, distancing women from sources of economic and food support. These experiences with discrimination and abuse contributed to internalized stigma among respondents who, as a result, were fearful and hesitant to disclose their HIV status; some participants reported leaving spouses and/or families, resulting in further isolation from economic resources, food and other support. A minority of participants described social support by friends, spouses, families and support groups, which helped to ameliorate food insecurity and emotional distress. Conclusions Addressing food insecurity among WLHIV requires policy and programmatic interventions to enforce existing laws designed to protect the rights of people living with HIV, reduce HIV-related stigma, and improve gender equality.",2017,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Internalized stigma,42

We address two marginalized populations at elevated risk of acquiring HIV: women who are married to men who also have sex with men (MSM) and wives of injection drug users (IDUs).We used a combination of focus groups (qualitative) and structured surveys (quantitative) to identify the risks that high-risk men pose to their low-risk wives and/or sexual partners. Married MSM were identified using respondent-driven recruitment in Tamil Nadu, India, and were interviewed by trainer assessors. A sample of wives of injection drug users in Chennai were recruited from men enrolled in a cohort study of the epidemiology of drug use among IDUs in Chennai, and completed a face-to-face survey. Focus groups were held with all groups of study participants, and the outcomes transcribed and analyzed for major themes on family, HIV and issues related to stigma, discrimination and disclosure.Using mixed-methods research, married MSM are shown to not disclose their sexual practices to their wives, whether due to internalized homophobia, fear of stigma and discrimination, personal embarrassment or changing sexual mores. Married MSM in India largely follow the prevailing norm of marriage to the opposite sex and having a child to satisfy social pressures. Male IDUs cannot hide their drug use as easily as married MSM, but they also avoid disclosure. The majority of their wives learn of their drug-using behaviour only after they are married, making them generally helpless to protect themselves. Fear of poverty and negative influences on children were the major impacts associated with continuing drug use.We propose a research and prevention agenda to address the HIV risks encountered by families of high-risk men in the Indian and other low- and middle-income country contexts.",2010,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Internalized stigma,79

Few studies have examined mental illnesses in the Roma, and none have examined the Roma children. The present study estimates mental health and behavioral disorders among Roma children in comparison to non-Roma children in educational institutions.Data were drawn from the School Children Mental Health Study in Europe (SCHME) study in Romania (Roma children identified by parent report, N = 70; non-Roma, N = 925) and Bulgaria (Roma children identified by exclusively-Roma schools, N = 65; non-Roma, N = 1312). The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was given to the parents and teachers to measure child mental health; children reported on their mental health through the Dominique Interactive. Control covariates included child sex and age, and parental characteristics when parent reports were available.Based on the child's own report, Roma children had a higher odds of any internalizing disorder (OR = 2.99, 95% C.I. 2.07-4.30), phobias (OR = 4.84, 95% C.I. 3.19-7.35), separation anxiety disorder (OR = 2.54, 95% C.I. 1.72-3.76), generalized anxiety disorder (OR = 2.95, 95% C.I. 1.75-4.96), and major depressive disorder (OR = 3.86, 95% C.I. 2.31-6.37).

10.2307/25149384,"""Ripped off"" by the System: Housing Policy, Poverty, and Territorial Stigmatization in Regent Park Housing Project, 1951-1991",,"Canada's oldest and largest public housing project, Regent Park in Toronto, was originally conceived as an ideal community for low-income families in housing hardship. By the 1990s, however, it had become virtually synonymous with socio-economic marginalization and behavioural depravity. Indeed, the broader social identity of Regent Park has become an accumulation and escalation of the stigma of its residents. The first section of this article charts the historical escalation of polarization between Regent Park residents and the Metropolitan Toronto population by comparing a series of broadly illustrative statistical traits over a 40-year period. This long-term historical perspective allows us to scrutinize the development of socio-economic marginalization both before and after the boom period of postwar capitalism from the 1940s to the 1970s. It confirms that Regent's resident population underwent a dramatic process of socio-economic divergence in comparison to the general Metropolitan Toronto population, which began in the mid to late 1960s before the onset of outright assaults on the welfare state. I flesh out the stark statistical portrayal by considering various qualitative sources such as oral testimony, letters to the author by former tenants, rare resident case files, and internal and public documents from the various housing authorities. In the second section, I explain the rise of socio-economic inequality. Contrary to currently popular underclass theories, I directly point the arrow of responsibility for rising poverty and inequality towards state housing policies, including wider urban renewal strategies and internal public housing practices, and neoliberal economic restructuring. Unlike most studies, I centre in a third section on the potently deleterious effects of stereotyping Regent Park as an outcast space. Stigmatizing renderings by external observers were not free-floating ideological representations but real reflections and shapers of spatial and social divisions with concrete economic and social consequences for tenants. I conclude by discussing what residents themselves thought about their homes and how they coped with stigmatization and material deprivation. Sometimes accepting and internalizing negative external representations and/or projecting these labels onto their neighbours and other times resolutely battling against these brutalizing depictions, Regent Park residents were always active players in building a meaningful living space.

			Le projet de logements le plus ancien et le plus grand du Canada, Regent Park a Toronto, a ete initialement concu comme une communaute ideale pour les familles a faible revenu ayant des difficultes a trouver un logement. Dans les annees 1990, toutefois, il a est devenu virtuellement synonyme de marginalisation socio-economique et de depravation comportementale. A vrai dire, l'identite sociale la plus large de Regent Park est devenue une accumulation et une intensification du stigma de ses residents. La premiere section de cet article trace l'intensification historique de la polarisation entre les residents de Regent Park et la population de Toronto metropolitain en comparant une serie de traits statistiques largement illustratifs sur une periode de 40 ans. Cette perspective historique a long terme nous permet de surveiller le developpement de la marginalisation socio-economique tant avant qu'apres la periode de grande prosperite du capitalisme d'apres-guerre, des annees 1940 aux annees 1970. L'article confirme que la population de Regent Park a subi un processus dramatique de divergences socio-economique en comparaison avec la population generale de Toronto metropolitain, qui a commence vers le milieu et la fin des annees 1960 avant que commence les assauts directs sur l'Etat-providence. J'enleve les statistiques pures en prenant en consideration des sources qualitatives variees telles que les temoignages oraux, les lettres envoyees a l'auteur par les anciens locataires, les rares dossiers des residents, ainsi que les documents internes et publics de differentes autorites en matiere d'habitation. Dans la deuxieme section, j'explique la venue de l'inegalite socio-economique. Contrairement aux theories populaires courantes des classes marginales, j'attribue la responsabilite de la pauvrete et de l'inegalite croissante directement aux politiques de logement de l'Etat, y comprises strategies de renouvellement urbain et les pratiques internes relatives au logement public, ainsi que la restructuration economique neoliberale. A la difference de la plupart des etudes, je me concentre dans une troisieme section sur les effets potentiellement dangereux de stereotyper Regent Park comme un espace ostracise. Les conclusions stigmatisantes des observateurs externes n'etaient pas des representations ideologiques libres, mais plutot de vraies reflexions sur les divisions spatiales et sociales ayant des consequences economiques et sociales concretes pour les locataires. Pour conclure, je discute de ce que les residents eux-memes pensaient de leurs foyers et de la facon dont ils ont fait face a la stigmatisation et a la depravation materielle. Quelquefois, ils ont accepte et interiorise les representations negatives externes et/ou projete ces etiquettes a leurs voisins; en d'autre temps, ils se sont battus contre ces expressions brutales. Quoi qu'il en soit, les residents de Regent Park ont toujours ete des participants actifs dans la construction d'un espace vital significatif.",2003,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Internalized stigma,58

This study determines: 1) differences in teen and parental report of obesity, 2) amount of misclassification using body mass index (BMI) from self-reported versus measured height and weight as an indicator of obesity, and 3) whether misclassification varies by gender and socioeconomic status.Weighted data from 15 483 baseline (T1) youth and parental interviews from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were used. Seventy-four percent of teens were reinterviewed 1 year later (T2). Parents reported socioeconomic status indicators and whether their teen was obese. Teens reported height, weight, and weight perception. BMI was calculated from both self-reported height and weight at T1 and T2 and from measured height and weight at T2. Those with a BMI > or =95% corrected for age and gender were considered obese.At T1, nearly one half of teens (47%) reporting they were very overweight were not obese by BMI. For teens obese by BMI, 19.6% were reported to be obese by both parent and teen, 6.4% by teen only, 29. 9% by parent only, and 44.2% by neither teen nor parent. For those with persistent obesity, teen and/or parental report failed to identify more than one third (34%) as obese; 23.4% were identified by both teen and parent report, 5.4% by teen report only, and 37.2% by parent only. At T2, the correlation between BMI calculated from self-reported versus measured height and weight for the overall population was very strong (r = .92). Specificity of obesity status based on self-reported BMI, compared with obesity status based on measured BMI was .996; sensitivity, .722; positive predictive value, .860; and negative predictive value, .978. Overall, 3.8% of teens were misclassified using self-report measures. Girls were no more likely than boys to be misclassified as obese using BMI from self-reported height and weight.Parental report is a better indicator of obesity than teen report of weight status, but parental and teen reports are both poor predictors of adolescent obesity. Using BMI based on self-reported height and weight correctly classified 96% as to obesity status. Thus, studies can use self-reported height and weight to understand teen obesity and its correlates/sequelae.",2000,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Internalized stigma,738

Stereotype endorsement, disadvantage awareness, and social-emotional challenges in socioeconomically disadvantaged children.",,"Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with social-emotional difficulties, including internalizing and externalizing problems, as early as toddlerhood. The aim of the current study was to understand whether economically disadvantaged children's beliefs about the consequences and correlates of poverty (poverty stereotypes) and their beliefs about their personal economic disadvantage contribute to their social-emotional functioning. Interviews were conducted with 94 socioeconomically diverse 4- to 9-year-old children, whose parents reported on their social-emotional functioning and family socioeconomic disadvantage. As hypothesized, among relatively socioeconomically disadvantaged children, perceived disadvantage was associated with social-emotional functioning. The same relation was not found for relatively socioeconomically advantaged children. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children who endorsed higher levels of personal disadvantage had more attention problems and more anxious-depressive symptoms than socioeconomically disadvantaged children who endorsed lower levels of personal disadvantage. In addition, only among socioeconomically disadvantaged children (and not among relatively advantaged children) was negative stereotyping associated with attention problems. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children who endorsed more negative stereotypes had higher levels of attention problems. There was no evidence of an association between negative stereotyping and anxious-depressive symptoms and no moderation of this relation by socioeconomic status. Implications and directions for future research are discussed in light of several relevant theoretical frameworks, including stigma consciousness, status anxiety, and critical consciousness.

While widely recognized, the health disparities in HIV and AIDS are not often discussed. In this article, we examine the factors underlying health disparities in the U.S. HIV epidemic. We first discuss the interlocking relationships between biological, social, and behavioral factors that drive HIV/AIDS epidemics. Guided by a well-established conceptual model of health disparities, we then describe the social positions of those most affected by HIV and AIDS, particularly racial and gender groups. Structural and economic conditions-including environmental resources, constraints, access to care, and psychosocial influences-are examined in relation to HIV disease trajectories. Greater attention to contextual factors and comorbidities is needed to reduce the health disparities in HIV/AIDS.",2013,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Internalized stigma,425

The poverty context contains attributes that place individuals at a disadvantage when launching a venture, conceptualized as the liability of poorness. Poverty also can engender characteristics consistent with entrepreneurial success, or poverty assets. The paper explores how the mindset can help overcome the liability of poorness, while poverty assets serve as a bridge to the mindset. A model is proposed with the mindset as a moderator between aspects of poverty and entrepreneurial outcomes. It is argued that the mindset must be adapted to reflect poverty contexts.",2021,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Mindset,50

In the current work, we focused on mindsets, which are beliefs about the changeability (growth mindsets) or the stability (fixed mindsets) of the level of poverty in society. We conducted six studies, two preregistered, using both cross‐sectional ( N = 763) and experimental methods ( N = 1361). First, we found support for our prediction that mindsets of poverty can serve to justify economic inequities. To this end, we explored the relationship of these mindsets with system justifying ideologies, we conducted experimental studies designed to motivate, or not, justification processes, and we examined the association between mindsets of poverty and stigma toward those disadvantaged within the economic system. Next, building upon a rich literature on mindsets, we explored the mechanisms by which mindsets predict stigma. Growth mindsets of poverty predicted less stigma, in part, through lower levels of essentializing those in poverty and blaming dispositional factors for economic inequality. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this work for efforts to counter negative attitudes and promote support for those living in poverty.",2022,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Mindset,5

The study was done by means of an exploratory, descriptive and contextual strategy inquiry conducted within a qualitative paradigm. Although both approaches led to changes on personal, organisation and community levels, changes differed in various ways in these three systems. The ABCD approach succeeded in enabling community members to engage and participate meaningfully with each other, and undergo consciousness changes from a poverty-influenced mindset to citizens who created and drove their projects in the community. The community members led their own development by co-investing their own assets, and enhanced these with assets from the outside. In comparison, communities not sensitised to ABCD were usually driven by the organisations, based on the needs and problems of communities. Securing funds for development initiatives and the rendering of services seemed to be a major focus. Communities who followed the problem-based approach were better off in the short-term, although projects showed less signs of sustainability.",2017,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Mindset,60

10.1002/ejsp.3039,Do mindsets shape intentions to help those in need? Unravelling the paradoxical effects of mindsets of poverty on helping intentions,,"Abstract Poverty remains a pressing problem, with social support playing a crucial role in its reduction. Drawing on previous research on health‐related mindsets, we propose that a growth mindset of poverty – that is, believing poverty can be changed – can have both positive and negative effects on helping intentions through increased outcome expectancy and blame, respectively. In three experiments, we found that a growth mindset of poverty is associated with increased outcome expectancy and blame, which, in parallel, mediate the relationship between mindsets and helping intentions. However, these contrary indirect effects negate each other, yielding a total null effect. Further, manipulating the relationship between mindset and outcome expectancy (but not blame) alters the relationship between mindset and helping intentions (Studies 2 and 3). By shedding light on the circumstances under which mindsets of poverty can diminish or amplify helping intentions, our research offers valuable insights for practitioners and charities dedicated to combating poverty.",2024,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Mindset,1

10.1002/pop4.283,The Liability of Poorness: Why the Playing Field is Not Level for Poverty Entrepreneurs,,"Entrepreneurship is increasingly emphasized as a pathway out of poverty. However, the complex, multi‐faceted nature of the poverty experience has important implications for the ability to launch and sustain viable businesses. All entrepreneurs must overcome the liabilities of newness and smallness, as reflected in a lack of legitimacy with stakeholders, inadequate resources and capabilities, an unclear identity, misunderstood roles and unclear role definitions, few established routines and procedures, and little bargaining power. However, poverty entrepreneurs face an additional barrier, which we term the liability of poorness. Four underlying dimensions of the liability of poorness are identified: literacy shortcomings, a scarcity mindset, significant non‐business distractions, and the lack of financial slack or a safety net. The manner in which each of these interacting elements exacerbate the entrepreneur's ability to address the liabilities of newness and smallness is explored. It is argued that, as the liability of poorness becomes greater, the vulnerability and fragility of the poverty entrepreneur's venture are apt to increase. Under such circumstances, significant external shocks and unexpected occurrences, such as the economic shutdown resulting from the COVID‐19 pandemic, typically have a more devastating impact on the ventures of the poor.

Using case study material from an award-winning football social enterprise, I outline how time spent in their deprived community establishing needs and ownership aided success. Also, recruiting local youth workers, developing authentic partnerships, and creating a non-judgemental environment delivered a positive 'ripple effect' beyond that possible from class-blind sport provision. However, 'win win' rhetoric ignores stresses from meeting financial requirements and moral dilemmas from trade-offs between social and business goals. The organisation's 'non-establishment' nature is partially undermined by emphasising local poverty of aspiration and the psychological thinking within Dweck's 'Growth Mindset' and Duckworth's 'Grit' research. The resulting focus on individual effort and learning from failure chimes with neoliberal thinking, ignoring how widening societal inequality and politics causes local problems and the need for structural changes for wider social impact.",2017,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Mindset,26

This paper presents the findings of a review of Nigerian entrepreneurship education literature published in 20 journals over a 16-year period. The purpose of this paper is to examine research contributions in the field of entrepreneurship education within the Nigerian context, with the aim of understanding the focus and the different research areas covered by researchers in this area, and to make suggestions that can guide scholars in their future research contributions. Design/methodology/approach Systematic literature reviews are recognized methods for conducting evidence-based research. The study adopted a systematic literature review approach, drawing from a computerized search of five selected databases, using predetermined key words by the researchers. Findings The main finding of this paper is that related concepts like skills, intention, drive and attitude have been used in expounding discussions on the outcome of entrepreneurship education, but very little has been written on entrepreneurial mindset, which other studies have suggested is a crucial point in the journey of an entrepreneur (Reed and Stoltz, 2011; Neneh, 2012). Furthermore, learning and teaching of entrepreneurship in the Nigerian higher education institutions seem to be more focused on creating awareness about entrepreneurship, as against the experiential approach that scholars have argued to be a prerequisite for developing the next generation of entrepreneurs (Bell, 2015). The study also found that over 80 percent of the reviewed articles are published in journals not ranked or indexed in the ABS journal rankings or the Scopus database.

This is expected to shift the paradigm of businesses from the current waste-oriented linear economy to ideally a zero-waste circular economy. Design/methodology/approach This is an analytical study building on the experience of European Venture Philanthropy Organizations (VPOs) that work with the primary objective of making impactful businesses successful, with capital protection and return on investment being of secondary concern. This paper suggests an incorporated institutional design that blends resources for promoting responsible businesses using a new hybrid financial mechanism, namely, equity-at-default (EaD) to replace collateral and foreclosure requirements with responsibility and compassion. Findings The research calls for changing the business paradigm from linear to circular, an incorporated institutional framework for venture waqf, purpose of the waqf to make impactful small businesses successful and designing a financial contract to loan in favor of responsible businesses that convert to equity stake for the waqf in case of default (EaD) replacing collateral and foreclosure requirements. Research limitations/implications This is a theoretical study motivated by the success of VPOs but assigns a new role to waqf institutions. Furthermore, the incorporated nature of waqf is a new idea and EaD is a new mechanism. Being new, these ideas have the risk of not being implemented. However, the broader message that waqf shall promote businesses that are inclusive of ecological concerns is generally applicable. Practical implications The paper has a significant practical implication to transform the responsibility and consciousness of businesses. Waqf is fundamentally a compassionate institution, and it must enhance the responsibility of businesses to become more inclusive of the environment and other species. It should also become more compassionate toward businesses that are in distress and default. In this sense, the paper tries to internalize compassion in financial contracting that can potentially change the architecture of lending. Social implications Altering businesses’ mindset from a waste-driven extractive linear economy to inclusive circular economy has a tremendous transformative role. This will have implications for enhancing business consciousness and responsibility. As poverty is a phenomenon of state of mind, changing the society’s state of thought in Muslim communities is expected to have basic positive implications. Entrepreneurs with a new mindset can have far-reaching positive impacts on the society. Originality/value The paper offers potentially innovative perspectives in four key areas and blends the different resources in an incorporated waqf that makes responsible entrepreneurs assume a partnership role in times of distress through EaD. Furthermore, the integration of compassion in financial contracting could have better implications for return on investment as well.

In dealing with resource scarcity, individuals' thoughts are narrowed to address immediate resource limitations, thus crowding out other information, a phenomenon called the scarcity mindset. To assess for indication of a scarcity mindset in sexual and reproductive decision making in rural Malawi, a setting with extreme resource scarcity, we collected qualitative data in the form of eight focus group discussions and 28 semi-structured, in-depth interviews with women and men of varying ages and marital status. Participants, who were of low socioeconomic status, described constant tradeoffs that they made to secure their daily needs. They articulated both the challenges of supporting many children and the need to bear many children to guarantee their own future support. While participants described wealthy people as being concerned with preserving resources (often through the practice of limiting childbearing), they described poor people as working to increase their probability of success against an uncertain economic future (without due consideration of contraceptive behaviours). We found qualitative evidence that a scarcity mindset may influence reproductive decision making among women and men in rural Malawi and may preclude the use of contraception in low-resource settings.",2019,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Mindset,8

Income uniquely accounted for 3% of the variance in self-efficacy scores, physical health for 10%, mental health for 78% and education for 1%.Given the known links between self-efficacy and workplace productivity, workers who are below the poverty line may be at risk of poor productivity due to the experience of poverty.

Perceived self-efficacy (PSE)—individuals’ perception of their domain-specific capabilities—fundamentally shapes these internal constraints and thereby drives economic behavior. Without sufficient PSE, individuals have little reason to invest greater effort or attempt anything new. Individuals with higher PSE set more ambitious goals, try harder, and persist more diligently. Such proactive engagement in perceiving and creating possibilities is often either ignored or implicitly assumed in simple optimization models. Growing evidence from psychology and economics suggests that PSE deserves greater attention.

In contrast, people who believe that the causes of poverty lie outside the control of the individual (i.e., make an external attribution) should perceive governmental assistance programs as a viable solution to poverty. In addition, it is possible that an individual's level of self-efficacy moderates the relationship between attributions as to the causes of poverty and proposals about solutions to poverty. Data used for this investigation were obtained from the Great Lakes Poll, a large-scale telephone survey of residents in the Midwest of the United States and the province of Ontario, Canada. Statistical analysis of the data via OLS regression found no support for the idea that self-efficacy serves as a moderator. However, support was found for the belief that an individual's attributions towards the causes of poverty are consistent with that person's proposed solutions to poverty. Thus, internal attributions towards causation of poverty predict individual solutions to poverty; conversely, external attributions towards causation predict external solutions for poverty.",2002,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self-efficacy,8

From a thriving paradigm, focus is placed on understanding the positive growth and thriving experiences reported by respondents, as well as the social, cultural, and personal resources that promote thriving. In the baseline interview, we employed a qualitative methodology to understand women's experiences of thriving.

In the follow‐up study, we created a thriving scale based on responses generated at the initial interview and prior research, then examined which of a number of social/cultural and personal factors predicted thriving 3 years after the initial assessment. Only measures of competence (self‐esteem and self‐ efficacy) and psychological well‐being were related to thriving. Path analyses testing the causal sequence of these variables revealed that negative affect contributed to decreased self‐efficacy and self‐esteem, but it did not have a direct or indirect effect on thriving. Greater self‐esteem positively predicted thriving. In contrast, positive affect did not contribute to either measure of competence, but had a direct effect on thriving.

Accounts of the lived experience of poverty were found to be very similar, despite massive disparities in material circumstances associated with locally defined poverty lines, suggesting that relative notions of poverty are an appropriate basis for international comparisons. Though socially and culturally nuanced, shame was found to be associated with poverty in each location, variably leading to pretence, withdrawal, self-loathing, ‘othering’, despair, depression, thoughts of suicide and generally to reductions in personal efficacy. While internally felt, poverty-related shame was equally imposed by the attitudes and behaviour of those not in poverty, framed by public discourse and influenced by the objectives and implementation of anti-poverty policy. The evidence appears to confirm the negative consequences of shame, implicates it as a factor in increasing the persistence of poverty and suggests important implications for the framing, design and delivery of anti-poverty policies.",2013,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self-efficacy,181

10.2307/353914,Social Capital and Successful Development among At-Risk Youth,,"Social scientists have been slow to appreciate the great diversity among the poor. Until quite recently, researchers have devoted more attention to examining patterns of persistent poverty than to understanding how individuals and families maneuver their way out of economic disadvantage (for exceptions, see Clark, 1983; Kellam, Ensminger, & Turner, 1977; Williams Kornblum, 1985). Evidence about mobility patterns among the poor provides a perfect analogy to the half-empty/half-full glass. Of individuals who begin life in poverty, at least as many manage to improve their circumstances as remain persistently impoverished (Duncan, Hill, & Hoffman, 1988). Yet relatively little is known about how and why some of the disadvantaged eventually escape while others remain entrapped in poverty. As researchers from different disciplines have begun to tackle this problem, they have, not surprisingly, each featured explanations congenial to their distinctive ways of looking at the world. Economists stress the importance of financial and human capital, highlighting how individuals invest time and money to improve their long-term position in the labor force (Palmer, Smeeding, & Torrey, 1988). Psychologists point out the importance of individual traits such as competence and self-efficacy, both of which are linked to upward mobility (Bandura, 1989; Garmezy, 1985; Rutter & Madge, 1976; Werner & Smith, 1982). Sociologists, for their part, underscore the importance of institutional resources and social networks in the communities where poor people reside (Granovetter, 1973; Wellman 8t Wortley, 1990). Of course, in reality these different sorts of mechanisms often operate in tandem. Perhaps the most interesting question, then, is how these various sources of differentiation among the poor are packaged together. Answering the question of how id why certain types of individuals locate and use resources that are often in short supply within their local environments to improve their own prospects, or the long-term prospects of their children, involves integrating the different disciplinary perspectives. This article draws on data from a longitudinal study of teenage mothers and their children to investigate sources of differentiation on several indicators of young adult success. In particular, we explore the role of social capital, a concept developed by Coleman (1988) that to some extent bridges the disciplinary gaps described above. Our goal is to determine whether successful outcomes among our sample of disadvantaged youth are related to measures of both family-based and community-based social capital. SOCIAL CAPITAL AND YOUTH DEVELOPMENT The process of investment in the economic, psychological, and social resources believed to be associated with upward mobility begins early in life and typically takes place within the family. Parents, in addition to utilizing their financial resources, cultivate and promote individual competencies in their children; with varying degrees of effectiveness, these same parents seek opportunities in the environment and attempt to shelter their children from dangers. Thus, the family represents a point of common interest to social scientists seeking to understand why and how certain children are able to escape the powerful disadvantage of growing up poor. Coleman (1988) employed the term social capital to designate the complex and variegated social mechanisms that parents garner to advance their children's chances of success. Coleman's description of social capital is quite broad and overlaps with some of the specific theoretical constructs and processes identified by developmental psychologists attempting to explain the successful adaptation of children at risk of long-term disadvantage (see, e.g., Garmezy & Rutter, 1983). Coleman's ideas also echo the approach to studying development formulated by Bronfenbrenner and his students (e.g., Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Garbarino, 1992; Steinberg, Dornbusch, & Brown, 1992). …",1995,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self-efficacy,689

We conducted in‐depth interviews ( n = 21) to describe parenting experiences and caregivers’ perceptions of their own parenting abilities and to create vignettes for use in directed focus groups. We carried out open focus groups ( n = 2) to gain social perspectives on parenting, and directed focus groups ( n = 2) concentrated on parenting self‐efficacy. Analysis involved memoing and inductive and deductive coding of transcripts. Caregivers’ perceptions of their own parenting were grounded in parenting values such as providing children with basic needs, having well‐behaved children, and having good relationships with children. Caregivers’ perceptions were influenced by challenges, including single parenthood, living with HIV, limited family resources, and mental health problems. When facing challenges, caregivers relied on social support and faith as well as their own parenting confidence. Caregivers’ perceptions of their parenting abilities were influenced by how they felt others perceived them, their satisfaction in the parenting role, their perseverance despite challenges, and the extent to which they had a vision for their family. Our findings contextualize parenting self‐efficacy within parenting values, challenges, and social perceptions among HIV‐affected caregivers in rural Uganda.",2019,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self-efficacy,4

10.1086/644459,Giving Back Control: Long-Term Poverty and Motivation,,"Traditionally, the poverty policy debate has been dominated on one side by those who focus on restricted opportunity as a cause of persistent poverty and on the other side by those who blame the ""deviant"" attitudes and values of the poor themselves. As the debate has gone historically, any observed difference in attitudes (beliefs in personal efficacy, future orientation, passivity, etc.) has been taken as evidence in favor of the cultural, attitudinal model of the cause of poverty. The policy implications of the cultural models have usually fallen within the conservative social policy agenda. As a result, many have been reluctant to discuss the possible motivational deficits of the persistent poor that limit their ability to achieve self-sufficiency. As is argued here, out of fear of ""blaming the victim,"" we have failed to recognize the full implications of victimization. This article seeks to develop a social-psychological framework for understanding attitudinal deficits produced by constrained opportunities and stigmatizing labels. Applying the psychological theory of control, the article uses the learned helplessness model not only to help understand motivational deficits of the persistent poor but also to point to the therapeutic value of choices in helping to restore the person's sense of control through the welfare system.",1987,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self-efficacy,134

Although observed measures of dyadic conflict were not directly related to women's ratings of self-efficacy, hierarchical regression analysis indicated that mother-toddler conflict served as a moderator. Specifically, higher maternal self-efficacy was associated with fewer risks for women experiencing higher levels of conflict. For mothers experiencing lower levels of conflict with their children, maternal self-efficacy was inversely associated with child's temperamental difficulty.",1999,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self-efficacy,79

In a sample of low-income participants with diabetes (N=711), we sought to determine if housing instability was associated with lower diabetes self-efficacy, and whether this relationship was mediated by food insecurity. We ordered housing from most to least stable. We observed a linear decrease in diabetes self-efficacy as housing instability increased (p<.01). After adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and alcohol or substance use, adults lacking a usual place to stay had lower self-efficacy than those who owned their own home (ß-coefficient -0.94, 95% CI -1.88, -0.01). Food insecurity mediated the association between housing instability and diabetes self-efficacy (ß-coefficient -0.64, 95% CI -1.57, 0.31).

10.5465/amj.2015.0715,Funding Financial Inclusion: Institutional Logics and the Contextual Contingency of Funding for Microfinance Organizations,,"Microfinance is a promising tool for addressing the grand challenge of global poverty. Yet, while many studies have examined how microfinance loans affect poor borrowers, we know little about how microfinance organizations (MFOs) themselves finance their lending activities. This is a significant oversight because most MFOs do not self-fund their lending, but, rather, rely on loans from external funders. To better understand microfinance funding, we apply and extend the institutional logics perspective to analyze the lending practices of commercial and public funders, who together provide most of the capital for global microfinance. We argue that these funders adhere to financial and development logics, respectively, and that this leads them to invest in different types of MFOs. Yet, in the face of uncertainty, we suggest that the practices motivated by these logics will start to converge in ways that are problematic for a nation's microfinance sector. Using a proprietary database of all traceable loans to MFOs from 2004 to 2012, we find strong support for our hypotheses. In particular, our findings show that the relationship between institutional logics and organizational practices is contextually contingent, and this insight contributes important understanding about the efficacy of microfinance as a poverty-reduction tool.",2016,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self-efficacy,192

Within a cohort of 12-year-olds, we find that measures of self-efficacy, sense of inclusion, self-esteem and educational aspirations all correlate with measures of the material well-being of the family in which they are growing up. In short, material circumstances shape these wider dimensions of child well-being. As other evidence has shown, these measures of psychosocial competencies reflect important life skills that affect children as adults and shape their future socioeconomic status. This suggests a mechanism by which poverty may be transmitted across generations. In addition, our evidence shows how a caregiver's education and school participation affects children's psychosocial competencies. This may indicate a possible means of overcoming such transmission of poverty over time.",2009,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self-efficacy,84
10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.1,Social Cognitive Theory: An Agentic Perspective,,"▪ Abstract The capacity to exercise control over the nature and quality of one's life is the essence of humanness. Human agency is characterized by a number of core features that operate through phenomenal and functional consciousness. These include the temporal extension of agency through intentionality and forethought, self-regulation by self-reactive influence, and self-reflectiveness about one's capabilities, quality of functioning, and the meaning and purpose of one's life pursuits. Personal agency operates within a broad network of sociostructural influences. In these agentic transactions, people are producers as well as products of social systems. Social cognitive theory distinguishes among three modes of agency: direct personal agency, proxy agency that relies on others to act on one's behest to secure desired outcomes, and collective agency exercised through socially coordinative and interdependent effort. Growing transnational embeddedness and interdependence are placing a premium on collective efficacy to exercise control over personal destinies and national life.",2001,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self-efficacy,12607

However, much of this evidence is correlational, and this paper aims to address a call for more research on dynamics. We use rich panel data to evaluate within-individual dynamics in financial management and mental health. We observe increased (decreased) difficulty in managing financial affairs following periods of increased (reduced) psychological distress. Importantly, these dynamics occur in the absence of observable changes to objective financial circumstances (i.e. income and wealth shocks), and are robust with respect to a range of alternative approaches to measurement. Further, we show that most of the association between change in psychological distress and change in financial precariousness (concurrently and subsequently) can be attributed to change in self-efficacy. This supports the idea that investment in mental health will yield important additional benefits via the capacity to empower individuals to make better decisions and escape mental health-based poverty-traps.",2024,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self-efficacy,2

Cross-national differences and personality style constructs of external and internal locus of control were used in a MANCOVA design. No significant interaction differences appeared between national status and locus of control, which gave no support to the main hypothesis of this study that respondents from individualistic cultures (South Africa) have internal locus of control and make more individualistic attributions of poverty. Lebanese students were more structuralistic, and had more external than internal locus of control than South Africans. The independent variable of class did not appear as a predictor to the structural attribution for poverty. Hence, university education may be the most important factor in the attributions of poverty. Conceptualization in the design as to how individuals see poverty outside their immediate environment and how this can affect the formation of their poverty attitudes are suggested as areas for further research.",2006,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and locus of control,16

The article begins by discussing the perceived causes of poverty and their taxonomic properties (locus, stability, and controllability). One antecedent of causal beliefs, political ideology, is then examined in detail, followed by a review of the effects of causal beliefs on emotions and behavior. It is contended that helping the poor is a moral issue, but the moral evaluation concerns the targeted recipient of aid rather than the potential help giver. Persons perceived as responsible for their plight, a dominant construal for conservatives, elicit anger and neglect. In contrast, those seen as not responsible for their financial hardship, an outlook predominantly endorsed by liberals, arouse sympathy and help giving. Sympathy is the most important proximal determinant of aid. This analysis is extended to reactions to achievement failure, abortion, and rape.

Mead presented an interesting argument as to why poverty exists in the United States. He problematizes the culture of the poor of which ethnic minorities over-represent. By referring to the geographic regions from which these ethnic minorities came from, he globalised the question of poverty in the US. This invites a global policy debate rather than a US-centric policy debate. Indeed, Mead so freely made references to Africa and the African culture severally throughout his commentary. It is against this backdrop that I show that Mead was right to a large extent on the question of inner-driven individualised orientation. However, he overestimates its influence and misreads what culture is. He presented the culture of poverty as the antecedent of poverty. It was concluded that manipulating both internal drive (internal locus of control) and the structure of society is a more effective way to tackle poverty.",2022,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and locus of control,2

This empirical study examines perceptions of the causes of poverty of three groups of undergraduate social work students. Results confirm that students appear to develop beliefs about poverty that are consistent with desired professional values. Beginning, intermediate, and advanced BSW students rated structural explanations as the most salient and accorded the least importance to factors related to personal client deficiencies. However, a rise in fatalistic interpretations of poverty along with an increasingly external locus of control orientation characterized students who had completed their social welfare policy course.

One possible explanation is that they have low aspirations and form mental models of their future opportunities which ignore some options for investment. This paper reports on a field experiment to test this hypothesis in rural Ethiopia. Individuals were randomly invited to watch documentaries about people from similar communities who had succeeded in agriculture or business, without help from government or NGOs. A placebo group watched an Ethiopian entertainment programme and a control group were simply surveyed. In addition, the number of people invited was varied by village to assess the importance of peer effects in formation of aspirations. Six months after screening, aspirations had improved among treated individuals and did not change in the placebo or control groups. Treatment effects were larger for those with higher pre-treatment aspirations. We also find treatment effects on savings, use of credit, children’s school enrolment and spending on children’s schooling, suggesting that changes in aspirations can translate into changes in a range of forward-looking behaviours. There are also treatment effects on measures from psychology and sociology, including locus of control, which theory predicts should behave in similar ways to aspirations. Most effects are robust to corrections for multiple testing. Peer effects result in further impact on educational spending and induce more work and less leisure. The result that a one-hour documentary shown six months earlier induces actual behavioural change suggests a challenging, promising avenue for further research and poverty-related interventions.",2014,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and locus of control,164

Overall, there was no clear evidence that intervening to change the educational attitudes of disadvantaged students will lead to enhanced attainment. Some mental concepts, such as external motivation, show promise and could be developed further. Others, like locus of control, show little promise and could even be dangerous if used without care. Given that there are other approaches that can help to overcome the poverty gradient in schools, raising aspirations is not the way for policy to go. The stratification of educational outcomes is more likely to be structural rather than mental. An improved attitude without the competence to do something about it could be ineffective, whereas competence may be sufficient in isolation. The current evidence is that attitudes do not cause variation in attainment, and so policies and practices based on a belief that they do are being, and will continue to be, ineffective. Such policies also present opportunity costs, using budget that could be used for more promising approaches, and leaving the poverty gradient largely untouched for yet another generation.",2012,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and locus of control,75

These milieus usually have high rates of absolute poverty and relative economic deprivation, as well as weak social institutions. The persistent findings of delinquent peer contributions to delinquency have yet to be tested under conditions where social class and milieu effects are controlled. There is little empirical evidence to determine how adolescents in high‐crime neighborhoods avoid delinquency despite frequent contact with delinquent peers. The differences between violent delinquents and other youths from comparable neighborhoods are little understood. This study contrasts a sample of chronically violent male juvenile offenders with the general male adolescent population (students and school dropouts) from inner‐city neighborhoods in four cities. Violent delinquents differ from other male adolescents in inner cities in their attachments to school, their perceptions of school safety, their associations with officially delinquent peers, their perceptions of weak maternal authority, and the extent to which they have been victims of crime. Peer delinquency and drug“problems” predict the prevalence of three delinquency offense types for both violent offenders and neighborhood youths. Among violent delinquents, there appear to be different explanatory patterns, with one type better described by internal controls (locus of control), a developmental measure. Overall, there is strong support for integrated theory including control and learning components, and similar associations exist among inner‐city youths as in the general adolescent male population. Despite the generally elevated rates of delinquency in inner cities, the explanations of serious and violent delinquency appear the same when subjects are sampled at the extremes of the distribution of behavior.",1986,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and locus of control,95

Chinese local governments tend to concentrate their limited policies and initiatives on targeting STEs and effective ways to achieve better performance, following the proposed government policy called Targeted Poverty Alleviation by Tourism Development (TPATD). To discover which group is targeted and how, this study classified small tourism entrepreneurs and examined determinants of their performance. A quota sampling survey of 273 entrepreneurs in five tourism communities within a scenic area known as Yuntai Mountain was conducted in 2016. Seven determinants were identified: business skills, leadership, innovation, social relations, governmental support, autonomy, and locus of control. Three distinct small tourism entrepreneur segments were classified as independents, followers, and autodidacts. Each segment is worth helping but in different ways.

Factors that influence emotional disturbance in adults living in extreme poverty. Scandinavian Journal of Psychology 53, 158–164. Living in poverty conditions implies exposure to severe circumstances of social disadvantage, associated with greater propensity to contract illnesses. A negative correlation has consistently been observed between health and poverty. The chronic exposure to stress affects people’s well‐being through the development of symptoms of anxiety and depression. The suffering of these symptoms for a long time period may be considered as part of a more general syndrome of emotional disturbance, in detriment to a person’s mental health. The objective of this study is to identify psychological factors that influence emotional disturbance, measured as symptoms of anxiety and depression, in adults living in poverty conditions in Mexico’s central region. A total of 913 adults, 65.2% female, were surveyed. The mean age of the participants was 43.71 ( ± 12.58) years and the mean number of years of schooling was 4.04 (±3.36). Variables corresponding to personal characteristics were measured. The results indicate that the most important risk factor for depression is anxiety and vice versa. Additionally, gender, negative self‐esteem, lack of adequate strategies for confronting and resolving difficulties, and lack of self‐regulation predicted depression, whereas stress, lack of self‐regulation, and coping style predicted anxiety. These variables were better predictors than optimism, locus of control, sense of humor or religiosity.",2011,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and locus of control,20

Data were collected from young adults studying at university. The sample comprised 252 participants whose ages ranged between 17 and 35 and who were studying on different programs at university. Of the participants, 155 (61%) were female and 97 were male (39%) students. The scenario sample used in the prototype analyses was used as the data collection instrument. The data were analyzed by means of a prototype analysis method in order to identify the concept of dependency in interpersonal relationships and dependent relationships. As a result of the prototype analysis, three different head categories and 71 features were identified. The tables demonstrate these features in rank order in terms of representing the category in the best way.  These categories are defined as, a) interpersonal dependency, b) dependent individuals’ characteristics and c) indicators of a dependent relationship. Showing love, trust building and giving arm emerged as the prototype of interpersonal dependency concept. Inability to act by oneself, anxiety, lack of confidence, self-denial and being open to indoctrination emerged as the prototype of dependent personal characteristics. Inability to live without the dependable person, feeling the constant need to be near him/her, desire to satisfy him/her, placing that person in the center of one's life, and the need to be informed about that person also emerged as the prototype of a dependent relationship. It was found out that the prototype of dependency in interpersonal relationships and the prototype of dependent relationship indicators comprise both positive and negative characteristics. It is observed that the prototype of dependent individual characteristics is generally perceived negatively.

Due to poverty and high unemployment, some girls aspire to early marriage. Two pathways to early marriage are identified: first, poverty and gendered economic disparities motivate girls to begin transactional sexual activity at an early age, leading parents to favour early marriage as a risk-reduction measure. Second, educational opportunities are often closed off to girls before marriage, as a result of which early marriage becomes the only culturally approved pathway that allows girls to present themselves to others as a self-sufficient agent. These pathways are reinforced by cultural and religious concepts surrounding the transition from childhood to adulthood. The study finds that, in urban Tanzania, two important factors associated with early marriage are the prevalence of premarital sex leading to out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and the relatively high cost of secondary schooling, which blocks educational opportunities for girls after the age of 15.",2017,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self concept,101

Specifically, it investigates the effects of branding and advertising on the formation of selfconcept clarity (SCC) and consumer susceptibility to interpersonal influence (CSII). A comparative study was conducted between two groups, low‐ and high‐income teenagers, assessing SCC and CSII by means of quantitative scales. It was found that low‐income teenagers are less clear in their self‐concept and are more susceptible to interpersonal influence than their high‐income counterparts. A significant negative correlation between the two scales revealed that the less clear one's self‐concept is, the more susceptible one is to interpersonal influence. It is proposed that an inability to “keep up” with the latest fashion trends (due to restricted consumption opportunities) may result in a damaged self‐concept among low‐income teenagers, which leads to heightened susceptibility to consumption pressures and hence heightens the negative socio‐psychological impacts of living in poverty. The results of the study are reviewed in terms of branding, advertising, and consumer behavior and a proposed conceptual model of branding's impact on low‐income teenagers is presented as a “vicious cycle.” © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2008,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self concept,78

This randomized controlled trial examined whether an interactive virtual poverty simulation created in Second Life ® would improve nursing students’ empathy with and attributions for people living in poverty, compared to a self-study module. We created a multi-user virtual environment populated with families and individual avatars that represented the demographics contributing to poverty and vulnerability. Participants ( N = 51 baccalaureate nursing students) were randomly assigned to either Intervention or Control groups and completed the modified Attitudes toward Poverty Scale pre- and post-intervention. The 2.5-hour simulation was delivered three times over a 1-year period to students in successive community health nursing classes. The investigators conducted post-simulation debriefings following a script.

10.1111/j.1471-0366.2012.00376.x,The Role of Microfinance in Contemporary Rural Development Finance Policy and Practice: Imposing Neoliberalism as ‘Best Practice’,,"Microcredit emerged in the 1970s as a mechanism whereby virtually all poor individuals could supposedly escape their poverty through self‐help and individual entrepreneurship. Crucially, neoliberal policy‐makers found the microcredit concept ideologically compelling, and the international development community soon began to provide massive support to establish and expand the microfinance movement. Today, however, even long‐standing microfinance advocates now reluctantly accept that microcredit has actually had no positive impact upon poverty or ‘bottom‐up’ rural development. In fact, those rural communities most exposed to microcredit have been severely damaged in a number of ways, especially through sub‐prime‐style ‘boom‐to‐bust’ episodes. Largely because of its supreme ideological usefulness, the microfinance movement nonetheless still retains some support in the major neoliberal‐oriented international development institutions, pro‐globalization think‐tanks, and in a number of Western governments.",2012,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self concept,77
10.5840/beq201323326,The Poor as Suppliers of Intellectual Property: A Social Network Approach to Sustainable Poverty Alleviation,,"ABSTRACT: We extend the Base of the Pyramid (BoP) poverty-alleviation approach by recognizing the poor as valuable suppliers—specifically of intellectual property. Although the poor possess huge reserves of intellectual property, they are unable to participate in global knowledge networks owing to their illiteracy and poverty. This is a crippling form of social exclusion in today’s growing knowledge economy because it adversely affects their capabilities for advancement at several levels. Providing the poor access to global knowledge networks as rightful participants—as suppliers of intellectual property—leads to poverty alleviation as a result of their increased social inclusion, not only through economic benefits, but also through the poor’s improved well-being as a result of their increased self-esteem and dignity. Using concepts from social network theory, we develop a poverty-alleviation approach to harness and integrate the intellectual property of the poor into global knowledge networks through trust-based partnerships among the poor, non-governmental organizations, and multinational corporations.",2013,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self concept,56
10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01611,Estimating the Epidemiology and Quantifying the Damages of Parental Separation in Children and Adolescents,,"Parental separation is linked to multiple negative outcomes for children in all spheres of life. A field study was designed to estimate the epidemiology and to quantify the outcomes on the wellbeing of children from separated parents. Thus, data on socio-economic status, psychological adjustment, behavioural disorders, social relations, self-concept, and academic achievement were gathered from 346 children and adolescents, 173 separated parents, and 173 parents from intact families in the paediatric catchment area of Galicia (Spain). The results showed that parental separation had a significant negative impact on the children's and adolescents' family income (increasing the probability of falling below the poverty line); psychological adjustment (i.e., higher scores in anxiety, depression, hostility, paranoid ideation and interpersonal alienation); social relations (i.e., less self-control in social relations; higher social withdrawal); self-concept (lower levels of academic, emotional, physical and family self-concept), and academic achievement (lower academic achievement with higher school dropout rates). Moreover, children from separated families had a higher probability of being exposed to gender violence. Epidemiologically, parental separation is associated to the probability of falling below the poverty line 33.9%; being exposed to gender violence 43.2%; and symptoms such as depression, anxiety, hostility, paranoid ideation interpersonal alienation, and social withdrawal i.e., 20, 17, 27, 20, 19%, and 35.5%, respectively. Inversely, self-control in social relations, and academic, emotional, physical, and family self-concept fell to 16, 32, 27, 22%, and 37%, respectively.

These skills are influenced by different individual and contextual factors at multiple levels of analysis (i.e., individual, family, social, and cultural). Available evidence suggests that the influences of those biological, psychosocial, and sociocultural factors on emotional and cognitive development can vary according to the type, number, accumulation of risks, and co-occurrence of adverse circumstances that are related to poverty, the time in which these factors exert their influences, and the individual susceptibility to them. Complementary, during the past three decades, several experimental interventions that were aimed at optimizing development of self-regulation of children who live in poverty have been designed, implemented, and evaluated. Their results suggest that it is possible to optimize different aspects of cognitive performance and that it would be possible to transfer some aspects of these gains to other cognitive domains and academic achievement. We suggest that it is an important task for ethics, notably but not exclusively neuroethics, to engage in this interdisciplinary research domain to contribute analyses of key concepts, arguments, and interpretations. The specific evidence that neuroscience brings to the analyses of poverty and its implications needs to be spelled out in detail and clarified conceptually, notably in terms of causes of and attitudes toward poverty, implications of poverty for brain development, and for the possibilities to reduce and reverse these effects.",2017,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self concept,47

It affects diet, nutrition, employment, housing, self-concept, and the entire educational experience. Ironically, Americans have always looked to education as a means of breaking the seemingly endless cycle of poverty. But rather than serve as a great ladder carrying all who climb with concerted effort to social and economic equality, current research suggests some educational structures may actually limit opportunities for certain children. This paper focuses on education in American society and how it may influence inequality . It addresses the question of why students from various social classes differ significantly in academic achievement and it critiques the major theoretical explanations for this difference. Finally, it supports the idea that specific educational structures perpetuate the cycle of poverty by determining educational outcomes and limiting the economic life chances of children. One such educational structure, tracking, or separation by ability, is the focus of this paper. Tracking is a reality in the American school system. Considerable research has revealed class, gender, and race biases with less-advantaged children more often placed in the lower tracks. This paper examines tracking on a national and international basis. It explores various processes within the tracks that limit a child's development and, in turn, have an impact on future economic opportunities. In sum, it examines how tracking may perpetuate the endless cycle of poverty.",2001,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self concept,59
10.14989/70892,Islamic Microfinance: A Missing Component in Islamic Banking,,"Microfinance means “programme that extend small loans to very poor people for self employment projects that generate income in allowing them to take care of themselves and their families” (Microcredit Summit, 1997). The World Bank has recognized microfinance programme as an approach to address income inequalities and poverty. The microfinance scheme has been proven to be successful in many countries in addressing the problems of poverty. The World Bank has also declared 2005 as the year of microfinance with the aim to expand their poverty eradication campaign. The main aim of the paper is to assess the potentials of Islamic financing schemes for micro financing purposes. The paper argues that Islamic finance has an important role for furthering socio-economic development of the poor and small (micro) entrepreneurs without charging interest (read: riba’). Furthermore, Islamic financing schemes have moral and ethical attributes that can effectively motivate micro entrepreneurs to thrive. The paper also argues that there is a nexus between Islamic banking and microfinance as many elements of microfinance could be considered consistent with the broader goals of Islamic banking. The paper, first, introduces the concepts of microfinance, and presents a case for Islamic microfinance to become one of the components of Islamic banking. The paper then discusses, the potentials of various Islamic financing schemes that can be advanced and adapted from microfinance purposes including techniques to mitigate the inherent risks. Finally, the paper concludes with the proposals to accommodate the Islamic microfinance within the present Islamic banking structure. 2. Principles of Microfinance Microfinance grew out of experiments in Latin America and South Asia, but the best known start was in Bangladesh in 1976, following the wide-spread famine in 1974. Advocates argue that the microfinance movement has helped to reduce poverty, improved schooling levels, and generated or expanded millions of small businesses. The idea of microfinance has now spread globally, with replications in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and Eastern Europe, as well as richer economies like Norway, the United States, and England. Among the features of microfinance is disbursement of small size loan to the recipients that are normally micro entrepreneurs and the poor. The loan is given for the purpose of new income generating project or business expansion. The terms and conditions of the loan are normally easy to understand and flexible. It is provided for short term financing and repayments can be made on a weekly or longer basis. The procedures and processes of loan disbursements are normally fast and easy. Additional capital can also be given after the full settlement of the previous loan.",2007,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self concept,138

This concept closely parallels the “capability poverty” measure that has been proposed by Amartya Sen. We use this measure to examine the trend and composition of the Self‐Reliant poor population from 1975 to 1997. We find that Self‐Reliant poverty has increased more rapidly over this period than has official poverty. Families considered to be the most vulnerable—those headed by minorities, single women with children, and individuals with low levels of education—have the highest levels of Self‐Reliant poverty. However, these groups have also experienced the smallest increases in poverty. Conversely, families largely thought to be economically secure—those headed by whites, married men with children, and highly educated individuals—have the lowest levels of Self‐Reliant poverty, but have experienced the largest increases in poverty. We also find that the Self‐Reliant poor is increasingly composed of vulnerable groups relative to the composition of the official poor. The labor market, demographic, and policy sources of the divergent trends in Self‐Reliant and official poverty, and of the gender, race and family structure changes in poverty rates are explored.",2001,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self concept,35

The design was a qualitative study using focus group discussion. Four focus groups of South Asian women (using existing women's groups in Manchester, UK) formed the setting for this study. Each focus group was facilitated by one of the authors, and the discussions occurred in Urdu, English and Punjabi. An interview guide was used, although the direction of the discussions followed the women's agenda. Notes were taken during the focus group discussions. Analysis of notes to define themes and emergence of framework was carried out. The data were analysed according to the principles of framework analysis. A range of systemic issues were described by respondents including: social, political and economic pressures; domestic violence; poverty; language problems; family and children's issues; and health. These experiences were reinforced by an extremely efficient community grapevine and were evident in described experiences such as: racism and stereotyping of Asian women; Asian communities and Islam; and the concept of izzat (honour) in Asian family life, which was seen as a major influence in the lives of Asian women. These experiences were thought to result in mental distress, which was described in a variety of ways by the women. The women saw self-harm as a usable coping strategy to deal with their distress. Perceived barriers to services were described by the women. Services tended to be accessed only at a point of desperation, rather than prior to crisis points. This indicated the need for services to be able to respond rapidly when Asian women did ask for help. Whilst the present paper describes a local study, thus limiting its generalisability, the use of such work in commissioning local health and social services is outlined. A number of indicators for good practice were drawn up in relation to addressing systemic issues in service provision using these findings. Such indicators will be of use by primary care trusts in developing, commissioning and monitoring services for this patient group.",2002,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self concept,115
10.1002/jid.784,"The World Development Report: concepts, content and a Chapter 12*",,"Abstract The World Development Report (WDR) process set new standards for openness and consultation. Its concepts and content are a major advance on its 1990 predecessor. The intention that its concepts and content should be influenced by voices of the poor was partly fulfilled. Conceptually, the VOP findings support the multidimensional view of poverty as ‘pronounced deprivation of wellbeing’, and the use of income‐poverty to describe what is only one dimension of poverty (though this welcome usage is not consistent throughout in the WDR). Two concepts or analytical orientations were not adopted: powerlessness and disadvantage seen as a multidimensional interlinked web; and livelihoods. On content, three areas where the influence fell short were: how the police persecute and impoverish poor people; the diversity of the poorest people; and the significance of the body as the main but vulnerable and indivisible asset of many poor people. A weakness of the WDR is its lack of critical self‐awareness. Chapter 11 is self‐serving for the International Financial Institutions: it lumps loans with grants as concessional finance; it makes liberal use of the term donor, but never lender; and it does not consider debt avoidance as a strategy. The Report ends abruptly, a body without a head. Its multidimensional view of poverty is not matched by a multidimensional view of power and responsibility. A Chapter 12 is crying out to be written. This would confront issues of professional, institutional and personal commitment and change. It would stress critical reflection as a professional norm, disempowerment for democratic diversity as institutional practice, and personal values, attitudes and courageous behaviour as primary and crucial if development is to be change that is good for poor people. A new conclusion is suggested for the WDR, and a title for the World Development Report 2010. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",2001,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self concept,38

However, behavioral studies demonstrate that poor people with high self-esteem are often exempt from the deleterious effect of poverty and instead possess a happy and successful life. Here we investigated whether high self-esteem can buffer against the deleterious effects of poverty, as indicated by low subjective socioeconomic status (SSS), on the hippocampal gray matter volume (GMV) in a large cohort of young participants (N = 280). As expected, findings revealed that although low (vs. high) SSS was linked with a smaller hippocampal GMV, the deleterious effect of low SSS on hippocampal GMV was alleviated when the participants have high self-esteem. Commonality analyses further confirmed this observation. The current study suggests that positive psychological resources such as self-esteem may provide protection for the hippocampal atrophy in adversity.

The structural equation model was applied to elucidate the association between child poverty and low self-esteem, using family-level (parental mental health and parental involvement with children), school-level (school social capital), and community-level (parental social capital) factors. Child poverty was associated with low self-esteem. Child poverty leads to poor parental involvement, which can be indirectly associated with poor parental mental health and poor parental social capital, and poor parental involvement was directly or indirectly associated with low self-esteem through poor school social capital. To mitigate the impact of child poverty on low self-esteem, comprehensive health policies targeting family-level (parental mental health and parental involvement with children), school-level (school social capital), and community-level (parental social capital) factors may be effective.",2019,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self esteem,38

This is an important shortcoming because this population, which is rapidly increasing in many western countries, is in a double minority condition and has a greater risk of experiencing psychological distress at school, in comparison with their native peers. In order to improve our understanding on this issue, the present two-wave study investigated the prospective relationships between peer acceptance and two aspects of well-being at school—intention to drop out of school and negative self-esteem—specifically focusing on the differential effect of having (vs. not having) an immigrant background. The participants were 249 preadolescents and adolescents living in poverty ( M age = 12.76; SD age = 2.34; 41.8% girls; 19.3% immigrants) who were attending educational centres for disadvantaged minors. The poverty status of the participants was an inclusion criterion. A multilinear regression model with multigroup analysis was tested. As expected, the results showed that peer acceptance had a significant negative association with school dropout intentions and negative self-esteem only for immigrants, but not for natives. For immigrant students, the protective effect of peer acceptance was comparable to the stability over time of dropout intention and self-esteem, a result that has promising implications for prevention programs. The applied implications of the study for educational and clinical contexts are discussed.",2021,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self esteem,36

Perceived poverty can harm impoverished college students' interpersonal interactions, psychological health and life satisfaction. This study explored the effect of perceived poverty on the life satisfaction of impoverished college students and the mediating role of self-esteem. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 1044 impoverished college students from 22 universities completed an online questionnaire that included a measure of perceived poverty, self-esteem scale (SES) and satisfaction with life scale (SWLS). Mplus statistical software was used to test whether self-esteem mediates the relationship between perceived poverty and life satisfaction. Results: Perceived poverty and life satisfaction were significantly negatively correlated, self-esteem was significantly positively correlated with life satisfaction, and perceived poverty was significantly negatively correlated with self-esteem. The structural equation model revealed that self-esteem partially mediated the relationship between perceived poverty and life satisfaction.

The use of validated and culturally relevant measures of mental health outcomes is crucial to the expansion of evidence. At present, there is a paucity of measures that have been tested and validated in contexts of extreme poverty. Using data from adult women living in extreme poverty in rural Haiti this study assesses the cross-cultural validity of the widely used Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and its applicability in assessing linkages between poverty and mental health outcomes. We find no evidence for a one-dimensional 10-factor structure of the RSES within our data and agree with other authors that the standard self-esteem model does not fit well in this cultural context. Comparisons with another widely used measure of mental health-the K6 measure-indicate that the RSES cannot be used as a proxy for mental health outcomes. We conclude that the use of the RSES in different cultural contexts and with samples with different socioeconomic characteristics should be undertaken with caution; and that greater consideration of the validity of psychosocial constructs and their measurement is vital for gaining robust and replicable insights into breaking the cycle between poverty and mental health problems.",2020,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self esteem,8

The numbers of parental involvement behaviors, parental interactions with their child, and parental care for their child’s physical health were treated as continuous and quartile, to see the association. Overall, the study showed that the larger the number of parental involvement behaviors, the higher the self-esteem score of their off-spring (p &lt; 0.01) among both adolescents living in poverty and not living in poverty, in which interaction between poverty and parental involvement behaviors was not significant. Both parental interaction with their child and parental care for their child’s physical health were associated with higher self-esteem, in which parental interaction with their child had a larger effect than parental care for their child’s physical health.

We considered three sets of variables in the latter analysis-mother's early characteristics and behaviors; correlated sociodemographic characteristics; and mediators (neighborhood problems, mother's psychological resources, and characteristics of the home environment) -and evaluated their relevance across three racial/ethnic subgroups (blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites). Consistent with our expectations, we observed a significantly stronger effect of the persistence of poverty on child problems for whites than for blacks, an effect that is attributable to the relatively strong association between poverty and mother's prior history of delinquency and current marital status among whites. The effect of poverty on child problems was substantially explainedfor blacks by mother 's early self-esteem, whereas mediating processes took on greater relevance for Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites.

Material wealth is at record levels, yet disturbing social problems reflect a deep spiritual poverty. In this compelling book, well-known social psychologist David G. Myers asks how this paradox has come to be and, more importantly, how to spark social renewal and dream a new American dream. Myers explores the research on social ills from the 1960s through the 1990s and concludes that the materialism and radical individualism of this period have cost us dearly, imperiling children, corroding general civility, and diminishing happiness. However, in the voices of public figures and ordinary citizens he now hears a spirit of optimism. The national dialogue is shifting away from the expansion of personal rights and towards enhancement of communal civility, away from efforts to raise self-esteem and towards attempts to arouse social responsibility, away from whose values? and towards our values. Myers analyses in detail the research on educational and other programmes that deal with social problems, explaining which seem to work and why. He then offers positive and well-reasoned advice, suggesting that a renewed social ecology for America will rest on policies that balance me thinking with we thinking.",2000,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self esteem,266

(b) Are adolescent self-esteem and family support associated with their drug use? Findings suggest that living in poverty had adverse effects on adolescent drug use. Compared to Black and Hispanic youth, these effects were more pronounced among White adolescents living in poverty. Adolescents with higher self-esteem were less likely to use drugs. Drug use differed depending on gender, number of siblings, maternal marital status, and maternal years of education. This study suggests that substance use should be addressed in ecological contexts, looking at both macro antipoverty programs and micro psychosocial and family support programs. Current policies should expand on and bring new prevention and intervention efforts to reduce adolescent drug use by considering these macro and micro factors.",2020,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and self esteem,1

There is a great deal of scepticism within international development circles. This scepticism is fuelled by widespread ideas about the political impact of globalisation and by the economistic ways of thinking about politics that are increasingly influential in international development organisations and aid agencies. This scepticism is not justified. Arguments about the political impact of globalisation are exaggerated. Economistic models of politics provide a biased account of the real politics of anti-poverty and lead to undue pessimism about the scope for poor country governments to tackle poverty by redistributing resources.,1999,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Optimism,18
10.1111/j.1467-9701.2004.00589.x,Halving Poverty by Doubling Aid: Is There Reason for Optimism?,,This paper criticises the World Bank as overly optimistic with respect to its ability to fine‐tune development aid and to focus it on countries with ‘good’ policies rather than on countries with ‘poor’ policies in order to raise its effectiveness. It is shown that recipient regions showed very different patterns of aid inflows and economic growth in the past and that aid flows yielded the highest correlation to growth when their magnitudes shrank. It is furthermore argued that categorising countries by quality of domestic policies is not only questionable at a given point of time especially in countries with failing governmental institutions and open borders as in many African countries. It suffers also from incentive problems so that countries receiving more aid can become victims of changes in their domestic policies which are more permissive and etatist to the disadvantage of private agents. The paper instead pleads for a shift to aid policies decoupled from country‐specifics and more oriented to fundamental ‘beyond border’ problems of the well‐being of the poor. An international endowment fund under supranational law should finance research and implementation of research findings related to common international goods as it was suggested by Sachs concerning aids and tropical disease research.,2004,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Optimism,14
10.5860/choice.50-5134,"How children succeed: grit, curiosity, and the hidden power of character",,"Why do some children succeed while others fail? The story we usually tell about childhood and success is the one about intelligence: success comes to those who score highest on tests, from preschool admissions to SATs. But in How Children Succeed, Paul Tough argues that the qualities that matter most have more to do with character: skills like perseverance, curiosity, conscientiousness, optimism, and self-control. How Children Succeed introduces us to a new generation of researchers and educators who, for the first time, are using the tools of science to peel back the mysteries of character. Through their stories--and the stories of the children they are trying to help--Tough traces the links between childhood stress and life success. He uncovers the surprising ways in which parents do--and do not--prepare their children for adulthood. And he provides us with new insights into how to help children growing up in poverty. Early adversity, scientists have come to understand, can not only affect the conditions of children's lives, it can alter the physical development of their brains as well. But now educators and doctors around the country are using that knowledge to develop innovative interventions that allow children to overcome the constraints of poverty. And with the help of these new strategies, as Tough's extraordinary reporting makes clear, children who grow up in the most painful circumstances can go on to achieve amazing things. This provocative and profoundly hopeful book has the potential to change how we raise our children, how we run our schools, and how we construct our social safety net. It will not only inspire and engage readers, it will also change our understanding of childhood itself.",2013,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Optimism,528

And yet despite the overwhelming adversity associated with poverty, many of these youngsters are able to bounce back. The purpose of this article is to describe social and psychological factors that help them defy the risks associated with being poor. We suggest ways in which resiliency can be fostered through school and community programs. Included in this are ways in which physical activity serves as an effective medium for promoting growth and renewed optimism. Guidelines for delivering physical activity programs for increasing resiliency are proposed. In these guidelines are personal requirements necessary for successfully working with underserved children and youth.",1997,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Optimism,156
10.31436/ijes.v9i4.378,The Influence of Urban Poverty on Students’ Academic Optimism: Does Government Assistance Play a Role?,,"The present study investigated the relationship between urban poor students’ perceptions of government assistance and poverty and their level of academic optimism. A survey was administered to 500 urban poor students in two major Malaysian cities, Kuala Lumpur and Johor Bahru. The students were identified and randomly selected for the study with the help of their respective schools. AMOS version 24 was used to test the hypothesised model using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The findings revealed a significant direct association between students’ perceptions of poverty and academic optimism. However, no significant indirect influence was found between students’ perceptions of poverty and their academic optimism through government assistance. These findings suggest that government assistance programmes are not necessarily a contributor to students’ academic optimism. The lack of any significant influence between students’ perceptions of poverty and academic optimism, through government assistance, may indicate a need to re-evaluate the existing assistance programmes rendered by the government to students in the urban poor category.",2021,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Optimism,2

Media discussion of poverty has shifted from arguments that focus on the structural causes of poverty or the social costs of having large numbers of poor to portrayals of the poor as cheaters and chiselers and of welfare programs doing more harm than good. As the frames have shifted, policies have followed. We demonstrate these trends with new indicators of the depth of poverty, the generosity of the government response, and media framing of the poor for the period of 1960–2008. We present a simple statistical model that explains poverty spending by the severity of the problem, gross domestic product, and media coverage. We then create a new measure of the relative generosity of U.S. government policy toward the poor and show that it is highly related to the content of newspaper stories. The portrayal of the poor as either deserving or lazy drives public policy.",2013,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Optimism,120

10.5860/choice.195387,The health gap: the challenge of an unequal world,,"In Aldous Huxley’s dystopia, Brave New World, there were fi ve castes. The Alphas and Betas were allowed to develop normally. The Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons were treated with chemicals to arrest their development intellectually and physically, progressively more aff ected from Gamma to Epsilon. The result: a neatly stratifi ed society with intellectual function, and physical development, correlated with caste. That was satire, wasn’t it? We would never, surely, tolerate a state of aff airs that stratifi ed people, then made it harder for the lower orders, but helped the higher orders, to reach their full potential. Were we to fi nd a chemical in the water, or in food, that was damaging children’s growth and their brains worldwide, and thus their intellectual development and control of emotions, we would clamour for immediate action. Remove the chemical and allow all our children to fl ourish, not only the Alphas and Betas. Stop the injustice now. Yet, unwittingly perhaps, we do tolerate such an unjust state of aff airs with seemingly little clamour for change. The pollutant is called social disadvantage and it has profound eff ects on developing brains and limits children’s intellectual and social development. Note, the pollutant is not only poverty, but also social disadvantage. There is a clear social gradient in intellectual, social, and emotional development—the higher the social position of families the more do children fl ourish and the better they score on all development measures. This stratifi cation in early child development, from Alpha to Epsilon, arises from inequality in social circumstances. Emphasising social circumstances and the social gradient is not to say that all diff erences in early child development can be linked to the social environment. Were the conditions under which children grew and developed to be equalised there would still be diff erences between individuals in cognition and social and emotional development. Twin studies show substantial heritability of cognitive ability, for example. That said, the Flynn eff ect refers to the substantial increases in IQ scores that have occurred over time that are due to the environment, broadly conceived. The evidence shows clearly that social conditions infl uencing parenting aff ect children’s ability to reach their potential and are the major determinants of the social gradient in early child development. This social gradient, in its turn, has a profound eff ect on children’s subsequent life chances. We see a social gradient in school performance and adolescent health; a gradient in the likelihood of being a 20 year old not in employment, education, or training; a gradient in stressful working conditions that damage mental and physical health; a gradient in the quality of communities where people live and work; in social conditions that aff ect older people; and, central to my concern, a social gradient in adult health. A causal thread runs through these stages of the life course from early childhood, through adulthood to older age and to inequalities in health. The best time to start addressing inequalities in health is with equity from the start. But intervention at any stage of the life course can make a diff erence. Relieving adult poverty, paying a living wage, reduction in fuel poverty, improving working conditions, improving neighbourhoods, and taking steps to reduce social isolation in elderly people can save lives. The health gradient to which these life course infl uences give rise is dramatic. There is a cottage industry, taking subway rides in various cities and showing how life expectancy drops a year for each stop. The gap at the ends of the gradient is truly large. In the London Borough of Westminster, UK, there is an 18 year gap in male life expectancy between the most and least salubrious parts of the borough. Similarly, in the US city of Baltimore there is a 20 year gap at the ends of the gradient. 20 years is huge—it is the gap in life expectancy between women in India and in the USA. Health inequalities are perhaps the most damning indictments of social and economic inequalities. These subway rides used social characteristics of area of residence. We see similar social gradients in health if we classify people by education, wealth, income, or occupational status. All societies have social and economic inequalities and all societies have social gradients in health, but the magnitude varies. At the UCL Institute of Health Equity, London, UK, we led a review of social determinants and health inequalities for the European Commission. As part of that review we examined life expectancy at 25 years by level of education. In each country there is a gradient in life expectancy—the higher the level of education, the longer the life expectancy. Three striking fi ndings emerged from the comparison. First, average life expectancy is lower in the countries of central and eastern Europe than in Sweden, Italy, and Norway. In other words we must add to our concern health inequalities between countries as well as those within countries. If we extend beyond Europe we see diff erences in life expectancy of 40 years and more. Second, the gradient is steeper in the east than in the west. Third, and linked to the steeper gradient, the country diff erences in life expectancy are much greater for people with little education than they are for people with tertiary education. The health risks associated with being low status vary greatly. The variation in health inequalities gives grounds for optimism. The data show shallower socioeconomic gradients are possible. Further, Estonia, Romania, and Hungary are able to achieve good health. They do it for people with tertiary education. The challenge is to bring the health level of the more disadvantaged up to the level Lancet 2015; 386: 2442–44",2016,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Optimism,612
10.1542/peds.2006-2775,Modeling the Impact of Formal and Informal Supports for Young Children With Disabilities and Their Families,,"The purpose of this work was to examine factors related to perceived impact of early intervention on children with disabilities and their families.A nationally representative sample of approximately 2100 parents completed a 40-minute telephone interview near their child's third birthday. Structural equation modeling examined the relationships between 3 support variables (quality of child services, quality of family services, and family/community support) and 2 outcomes at 36 months (impact on child and impact on family) and determined whether these relationships were mediated by 2 perceptual variables (optimism and confidence in parenting) or moderated by 5 demographic variables (poverty, maternal education, ethnicity, age of initial Individual Family Service Plan, and health at 36 months).Perceived impact of early intervention on both child and family were significantly related to each other. The quality of child services was related to impact on the child but not on the family. The quality of family services was related to both child and family impact. Informal support was not related to perceived impact on children or families but was strongly related to confidence in parenting and optimism. Neither optimism nor confidence in parenting mediated the relationships between services or supports and perceived impact. Minority families and families of children with poor health reported lower quality of services, but these characteristics did not moderate the relationships between services and perceived impact on the child. However, both poverty status and minority status were associated with perceptions of impact on the family.Findings reinforce the role of high-quality services in maximizing perceived impact. They also highlight the important role of informal support in promoting optimism and confidence in parenting. Poverty status, minority status, and poor health of the child are salient factors in predicting lower perceived quality of and benefit from services.",2007,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Optimism,68
10.1080/13540602.2014.937960,Teacher resilience: theorizing resilience and poverty,,"AbstractIn this article, I hope to provide some novel insights into teacher resilience and poverty on the basis of ten-year long-term ethnographic participatory reflection and action data obtained from teachers (n = 87) in rural (n = 6) and urban (n = 8) schools (n = 14, high schools = 4, primary schools = 10) in three South African provinces. In resilience debates, resilience in poverty-saturated schools is generally indicated as both process and outcome. Evidence from this study posits resilience processes in poverty as a lifeline chain, linking uninterrupted incidences of adaptation one after the other. Thus, rather than once-off incidental processes depicting a clear adversity beginning and positive adaptation end, adapting to poverty calls for resilience qualities characterized as a cable of nonstop vigilance. To mediate risk during resilience processes, the teachers in the study made use of traits such as compassion, creativity, optimism and especially flocking to access and use scarce protective resources. In the lifeline chain of resilience, the teachers demonstrated mostly positive outcomes as well as instances of maladaptation and thriving. Teacher resilience in poverty contexts means that teachers ceaselessly adapt in a sequence of linked incidents to a procession of risks. They use particular traits to unite and direct their adaptive series of behaviors in order to transform high-risk schools into supportive spaces where they sometimes thrive, and sometimes feel distressed but mostly function effectively as teachers.Keywords: teacher resiliencepovertyhigh-risk schoolssupportive schoolsteacher traitsadaptive coping processes",2014,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Optimism,96

10.5860/choice.43-1202,A normal country: Russia after communism,,"uring the 1990s, Russia underwent extraordinary transformations.It changed from a communist dictatorship into a multiparty democracy in which officials are chosen in regular elections.Its centrally planned economy was reshaped into a capitalist order based on markets and private property.Its army withdrew peacefully from eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics, allowing the latter to become independent countries.Twenty years ago, only the most naı ¨ve idealist could have imagined such a metamorphosis.Yet the mood among Western observers has been anything but celebratory.By the turn of the century, Russia had come to be viewed as a disastrous failure and the 1990s as a decade of catastrophe for its people.Journalists, politicians and academic experts typically describe Russia not as a middle-income country struggling to overcome its communist past and find its place in the world, but as a collapsed and criminal state.In Washington, both left and right have converged on this view.To Dick Armey, then Republican House majority leader, Russia had by 1999 become ""a looted and bankrupt zone of nuclearized anarchy"" (Schmitt, 1999).To his colleague, Banking Committee Chairman James Leach (1999a, b), Russia was ""the world's most virulent kleptocracy,"" more corrupt than even Mobutu's Zaire.Bernard Sanders (1998), the socialist congressman from Vermont, described Russia's economic performance in the 1990s as a ""tragedy of historic proportions""; liberal reforms had produced only ""economic collapse,"" ""mass unemployment"" and ""grinding poverty.""More recently, a glimmer of optimism returned.",2005,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Optimism,242

The study explored how different family and individual environmental factors foster academic resilience. The exploratory study took place with a group of six students from a public school in Bogotá, Colombia. The school is located in a low-income and marginalized area of the city, where social problems such as poverty and violence are common. Data collection techniques included document analysis, as well as interviews with teachers and parents. The data collection was focused on identifying how academic resiliency skills can be developed in vulnerable young people. It was found that it is possible to identify and describe different protective factors from the family, such as family guidance, family support, and opportunities for meaningful family involvement that explicitly foster academic resilience in at risk-students. It was also possible to address how individual characteristics also foster positive outcomes, including optimism, perseverance, or motivation.",2015,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Optimism,130
10.1080/01436597.2011.604520,Disability and Poverty: the need for a more nuanced understanding of implications for development policy and practice,,"Abstract The international development community is beginning to recognise that people with disabilities constitute among the poorest and most vulnerable of all groups, and thus must be a core issue in development policies and programmes. Yet the relationship between disability and poverty remains ill-defined and under-researched, with few studies providing robust and verifiable data that examine the intricacies of this relationship. A second, linked issue is the need for—and current lack of—criteria to assess whether and how disability-specific and disability ‘mainstreamed’ or ‘inclusive’ programmes work in combating the exclusion, marginalisation and poverty of people with disabilities. This article reviews existing knowledge and theory regarding the disability–poverty nexus. Using both established theoretical constructs and field-based data, it attempts to identify what knowledge gaps exist and need to be addressed with future research.

10.1002/polq.12303,Brazil: Reversal of Fortune,,"Despite recent problems of economic stagnation and social unrest, Brazil, in the last 20 years, has undergone a striking reversal of fortune. Policymaking institutions have improved, and better economic and social policies have resulted, leading to sustained low inflation, a long economic boom, and significant reductions in Brazil's notoriously high levels of poverty and inequality. These advances in governability and policy quality confounded the pessimistic predictions that dominated analyses of Brazil during the country's first decade of democracy (1985–1995). Yet they have also generated a degree of optimism about Brazil's economic and political future that probably is not warranted. Precisely how—and how much—has Brazil changed for the better since the early 1990s? Can we find a reasonable middle ground between the excessive pessimism of early analyses and the excessive optimism of more recent ones? For a reader interested in these questions, there are few better places to look than Alfred P.

10.1111/j.1728-4465.2000.00274.x,Can Poor Countries Surmount High Maternal Mortality?,,"Does poverty bind developing countries to high levels of maternal death in childbirth? Or, as safe‐motherhood advocates claim, do public health and social policy interventions have the potential to accelerate maternal mortality transitions? Globally, almost one in 200 live births leads to the death of the mother, making maternal mortality an issue of critical international import. This article presents an analysis of the determinants of national maternal mortality levels with a view to shedding light on these questions. A cross‐national regression of 64 countries shows that wealth indicators explain only a portion of the variance in national maternal mortality levels. Other determinants, including women's educational levels and the proportion of deliveries attended by trained health personnel, are more clearly associated with national maternal mortality levels than are measures of wealth. The results offer grounds for optimism concerning the potential for global safe‐motherhood efforts to induce maternal mortality transitions.",2000,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Optimism,100
10.1080/02681102.1998.9525287,Utilising information and communication technologies for development: The social dimensions,,"Abstract The literature on information and communication technologies (ICTs) is filled with rising optimism about the contribution of these technologies to economic and social development and their potential to transform developing countries into ""modern"" and knowledge‐based societies. However, as yet very little is known about the veracity of these claims, much less about the long‐term impact that ICTs may have on a country's social and cultural systems. While not refuting the developmental impact of ICTs, this paper argues that it is unlikely that quantum leap reversals of marginalization and poverty will result from technology transfer to the developing world. If nothing else, past experience shows that the notion of leapfrogging stages of development as a result of application of new technologies is dangerously naive and unrealistic. The paper cautions that developing country governments and international agencies should undertake a more rigorous analysis of the social and cultural dimensions of ICTs in order to be able to design appropriate policies and programmes which will enable countries to harness ICTs for development in their own context. It concludes that the best long‐term development investment that can be made using ICTs is to apply them to the training and education of the new generation, rather than to transform these technologies into short‐term ends in themselves. To achieve this, it is necessary to move towards strategic and better integrated national information, communication, and education policies.

From a risk-and-resiliency perspective, hopelessness was approached as a culturally specific response to family stress and other challenges encountered by Mexican immigrants. Although Mexican-heritage women and other Latinas have higher prevalence rates of psychiatric disorders than their male counterparts, they experience disparity in accessing mental health services. Multiple regression analysis was used to explore the relationships among hopelessness, depression, social support, and other variables. Culturally rooted resiliency and a sense of optimism connected to immigration appear to shelter Mexican-heritage mothers from hopelessness and depression. A very large households and nonworking status were found to elevate the risk of hopelessness. Because poverty and acculturation levels were not related to hopelessness or depression, further culturally specific research distinguishing hopelessness from depression is recommended. Given that hopelessness sometimes presents itself independently from depression, implications for practice include the need to refine mental health assessment tools to capitalize on the resiliency among immigrant mothers and avoid misdiagnosis.",2011,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Optimism,66
10.1177/003172170608800206,Ten Big Effects of the No Child Left behind Act on Public Schools,,"TEST-DRIVEN accountability is now the norm in public schools, a result of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act, which is the culmination of 15 years of standards-based reform. Many state and local officials believe that this reliance on tests is too narrow a measure of educational achievement, but NCLB has directed greater attention to low-achieving students and intensified efforts to improve persistently low-performing schools. For the past four years, the Center on Education Policy (CEP), an independent nonprofit research and advocacy organization, has been conducting a comprehensive and continuous review of NCLB, producing the annual reports contained in the series From the Capital to the Classroom as well as numerous papers on specific issues related to the law. (1) Each year, the CEP gathers information for this review by surveying officials in all the state departments of education, administering a questionnaire to a nationally representative sample of school districts, conducting case studies of individual school districts and schools, and generally monitoring the implementation of this important national policy. TEN EFFECTS Ten major effects of NCLB on American education are evident from this multi-year review and analysis. We describe these effects broadly, because our purpose is to assess the overall influence of this policy on public schools. The effects on particular schools and districts may be different. 1. State and district officials report that student achievement on state tests is rising, which is a cause for optimism. It's not clear, however, that students are really gaining as much as rising percentages of proficient scores would suggest. Scores on state tests in reading and mathematics that are used for NCLB purposes are going up, according to nearly three-fourths of the states and school districts, and the achievement gaps on these same tests are generally narrowing or staying the same. States and districts mostly credit their own policies as important in attaining these results, although they acknowledge that the adequate yearly progress (AYP) requirements of NCLB have also contributed. However, under NCLB, student achievement is equated with the proportion of students who are scoring at the proficient level on state tests, and states have adopted various approaches in their testing programs, such as the use of confidence intervals, that result in more test scores being counted as proficient. In addition, some national studies support our survey findings of increased student achievement, while others do not. 2. Schools are spending more time on reading and math, sometimes at the expense of subjects not tested. To find additional time for reading and math, the two subjects that are required to be tested under NCLB and that matter for accountability purposes, 71% of districts are reducing time spent on other subjects in elementary schools--at least to some degree. The subject most affected is social studies, while physical education is least affected. In addition, 60% of districts require a specific amount of time for reading in elementary schools. Ninety-seven percent of high-poverty districts have this requirement, compared to 55%-59% of districts with lower levels of poverty. 3. Schools are paying much more attention to the alignment of curriculum and instruction and are analyzing test score data much more closely. Changes in teaching and learning are occurring in schools that have not made AYP for two years. The most common improvements are greater alignment of curriculum and instruction with standards and assessments, more use of test data to modify instruction, use of research to inform decisions about improvement strategies, improvement in the quality and quantity of professional development for teachers, and the provision of more intensive instruction to low-achieving students. 4. Low-performing schools are undergoing makeovers rather than the most radical kinds of restructuring. …",2006,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Optimism,167

It further explores how their schooling experiences in precarious urban school districts influence their trajectories. Drawing on two ethnographic projects spanning three years each, the authors rely on participant observation, semi-formal and formal interviews, focus groups, and documents for their analysis. The authors apply the notion of 'cruel optimism' to explain the translation of refugee youths' aspirations post-arrival as they transition from war, refugee camps and illegal alienage to the grim landscape of public education in postindustrial cities like Philadelphia. Coping with residual trauma, interrupted schooling and the pressures of poverty, youth experience a 'continuum of precarity' in their lives that begins in their flight contexts and extends into their post-resettlement social worlds. As public education becomes increasingly unstable, their narratives offer a lens to consider the moral contradictions of third country refugee resettlement. Future research should tease out the unique and multiple transitions refugee youth make across contexts and how their interactions with educative institutions belie the humanitarian promise of better lives.",2016,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Optimism,65

As well as the economic optimism evident in the 'knowledge-driven poverty reduction' discourse, social equity goals underscore the reform and expansion of the system. Notwithstanding the widening participation and the equity policy provisions put in place, the problem of inequality has persisted along the lines of ethnicity, gender, rurality and socio-economic background. This paper reviews major equity policy instruments and highlights the enduring inequalities in Ethiopian HE. It argues that this persistence is related in part to the ways in which the problem is represented in policy, and that redressing the problem necessitates framing inequality as capability deprivation rather than as issues of access and disparities in enrolment.",2014,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Optimism,47

10.1093/tcbh/15.2.119,Poverty and Aspiration: Young Women's Entry to Employment in Inter-war England,,"This article examines young women's entry to employment in inter-war England. In doing so, it sheds light on a neglected aspect of their lives—paid work—in a period recently identified by historians as crucial in the emergence of the modern, independent young woman. It is argued that entering employment marked the beginning of a social, cultural, and economic transition from girlhood to womanhood. The relationship between gender, life cycle, and social class in inter-war England is reassessed. The period has been identified as one when a 'traditional' working-class identity was breaking down, with women's relationship to social class viewed as particularly problematic by those historians who have argued domesticity defined inter-war femininity. Contemporary social surveys, the Census and government records, and life histories demonstrate that young women's entry to and choice of employment was influenced by their social background, with kinship and neighbourhood networks used to locate and obtain jobs. Employment expansion increased the state's importance in directing girls to jobs, but poverty continued to constrain employment choice. Awareness of this informed young women's own social aspirations. Interwar femininity and youthful identity formation thus did not signify the decline of social class, but were rather shaped by it.",2004,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Aspirations,46

It is argued that, rather than widening opportunities, successive reforms in education and training have created a series of blind alleys for the (mostly working class) young people who are not high achievers, and that these experiences are the most likely reason for the subsequent strengthening of the weak relationship that exists at age 11/12 between, on one hand, social class backgrounds, then, on the other, pupils’ educational and vocational aims. The paper then proceeds to argue that at age 16 to 18 high achievers from working class homes are likely to face equally attractive opportunities to the kinds of higher education that they might otherwise enter.

This model of hope illustrates the vital role hope can play in the realization of causal effects from development interventions and how these effects emerge from the impact and interaction of three constituent elements of hope.

Our data and material come from ethnographic work with young men in two slum communities in the country's capital city, Nairobi. While acknowledging that, in their neighborhoods, 'proper' masculinity is constituted in traditional terms of marriage, hardiness, provisioning, breadwinning and self-reliance, youth in our study aspired to masculinities characterized by 'abler' breadwinnerhood, caring, positive emotions, relationality, and the rejection of violence. The masculinity aspirations of poor Nairobi youth are complex; fashioned at the crossroads of structural constraints and agentive projects for a good life, and simultaneously supportive and resistive of traditional hegemonic manliness ideals. These aspirations are limited by and reflect an objective condition of everyday and enduring inequality while also signifying a deep unmet yearning for positive social and livelihood changes.",2019,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Aspirations,16

It argues that among resource-poor populations, child migration sustains kin relations across generations and households and also facilitates children's progression through the life-course, thus it is fundamental to social reproduction. It reasons that formal education has greatly amplified this trend. Schooling has acquired symbolic value as the prime means of escaping household poverty and realising ambitions for social mobility. As such, elevated educational aspirations combine with systems shortcomings to stimulate school selection, school transfer and school-related child migration.

Based on the 'subjective' stream of entrepreneurship, our model portrays institutional rigidities and contradictions moderating the influence of aspirations on entrepreneurial action by affecting the subjective value that potential entrepreneurs place on their resources. Because the value of resources is subjective in our exposition, our model suggests specific institutional configurations where a change in aspirations among the poor may provide them with unique insights to exploit entrepreneurial opportunities visible only to them. Our 'poor-as-owners' model can be contrasted with interventionist approaches to poverty reduction, which are aimed at creating win-win entrepreneurial models between the poor and the non-poor. Several policy implications can be derived from our paper that may be more effective in achieving regional development and reducing regional disparities that arise from a higher incidence of poverty.",2019,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Aspirations,30

We present BPT in a single mental account version (BPT-SA) and a multiple mental account version (BPT-MA). BPT-SA investors integrate their portfolios into a single mental account, while BPT-MA investors segregate their port? folios into several mental accounts.

Opportunity structures are formed primarily by the inter‐relationships between family backgrounds, education, labour market processes and employers' recruitment practices. The paper describes how each of these structuring agents has changed over time, while emphasising that their combined predictive power is undiminished. Individualisation, together with the requirement that young people make more choices and exhibit reflexivity, are shown to be features of the current structure of opportunities rather than evidence of a weakening of these structures. The paper concludes that 'poverty of aspiration' and young people making the 'wrong choices' cannot explain current imbalances in youth labour markets. Rather, it is argued that the root sources of the imbalances lie in the opportunities within which different groups of young people are required to be reflexive and to make successive choices.",2009,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Aspirations,178

In this essay, drawing on fieldwork conducted in Jakarta, Indonesia, San Francisco (California), and Seattle (Washington), we address the question of how a geographic relational poverty approach can help us understand, or at least expand ways of thinking about these processes by attending to urban informality and the politics of poverty. Informality, a pervasive feature of the global South and North, functions as a survival strategy whereby the monetarily poor can compensate for their lack of income through commoning. Market‐driven, state underwritten urban development initiatives for housing those with wealth is limiting the conditions of possibility for the monetarily poor, and informality. This is compounded by emergent political discourses rendering informality as inappropriate, and the monetarily poor as undeserving of a right to the city. Yet long‐standing more‐than‐capitalist and communal informal practices pursued by the urban poor remain effective and necessary survival strategies, supporting residents whose presence is necessary to the city and whose practices challenge capitalist norms.",2020,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Aspirations,36

10.2139/ssrn.3695398,"Aspirations, Poverty and Education: Evidence from India",,"This paper investigates whether aspirations matter for education, which offers a common route out of poverty. We find that mother aspirations are strongly related to the child's grade achieved at age 18. The relation is nonlinear, suggesting there is a threshold, and depends on caste, household income and the village setting. The coefficients remain large and significant when applying control function estimation, using first born son as instrument. A similar strong relation is observed with learning outcomes, including local language, English and maths test results, and with attending school, but not with attending private education. These results are confirmed for outcomes at age 15. The findings provide direct evidence on the contribution of mother aspirations to children's education outcomes and point to aspirations as a channel of intergenerational mobility. They suggest that education outcomes can be improved more rapidly by taking aspirations into account when targeting education programmes, and through interventions that shape aspirations.",2020,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Aspirations,11

This should improve the capabilities of policy analysts and others working to reduce poverty, but it also makes analysis more complex. This article describes a simple schema which integrates multi-dimensional, multi-level, and dynamic understandings of poverty, of poor people's livelihoods, and of changing roles of agricultural systems. The article suggests three broad types of strategy pursued by poor people: 'hanging in', 'stepping up', and 'stepping out'. This simple schema explicitly recognises the dynamic aspirations of poor people, diversity among them, and livelihood diversification. It also brings together aspirations of poor people with wider sectoral, inter-sectoral, and macro-economic questions about policies necessary for the realisation of those aspirations.",2009,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Aspirations,228

In Afghanistan, the burden of poor mental health arises in contexts of pervasive poverty, social inequality, and persistent violence. In 2006, we conducted face-to-face interviews with 1011 children (age 11-16) and 1011 adult caregivers, randomly selected in a school-based survey in three northern and central areas. Participants narrated their experiences as part of a systematic health survey, including an open-ended questionnaire on major life stressors and solutions to mitigate them. Responses were analysed using an inductive thematic approach and categorised for quantitative presentation, producing a conceptual model. For adults, the primary concern is repairing their ""broken economy,"" the root of all miseries in social, educational, governance, and health domains. For students, frustrations focus on learning environments as well as poverty, as education is perceived as the gateway to upward social and economic mobility. Hope arises from a sense of moral and social order embodied in the expression of key cultural values: faith, family unity, service, effort, morals, and honour. These values form the bedrock of resilience, drive social aspirations, and underpin self-respect and dignity. However, economic impediments, social expectations, and cultural dictates also combine to create entrapment, as the ability to realise personal and social aspirations is frustrated by structural inequalities injurious to health and wellbeing. This study contributes to a small but growing body of work on resilience in public health and conflict settings. It demonstrates that culture functions both as an anchor for resilience and an anvil of pain, and highlights the relevance of ethnographic work in identifying what matters most in formulating social and public health policies to promote a hopeful future.",2010,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Aspirations,374
10.1111/ciso.12145,Housing the Contingent Life Course: Domestic Aspiration and Extreme Poverty in Peruvian Shantytowns,,"Abstract Peru's urban peripheries have long been shaped by the intertwining of urban development policies with Peruvians' domestic aspirations. Since the 1960s, different formulations of progressive and self‐help housing policies have relied on and reproduced a domestic life course model in which Peruvians' inexorable progress through the “domestic cycle” is mirrored in the steady transformation of their precarious, unconsolidated shantytown homes into “noble” (modern; concrete) constructions in fully urbanized neighborhoods. While shantytowns partially reflect this predictable life course temporality, they are also shaped by future imaginings and contingent time. People use shantytowns to fulfill ideals of adulthood, autonomy, and success, but also to hedge their bets, retreating from some relations while striving to forge new ones. Drawing on twenty‐one months of fieldwork in Peruvian shantytowns, this article examines informal urban development from a contingent life course perspective to demonstrate how Peru's urban peripheries are embedded in and shaped by Peruvians' efforts to pursue domestic life projects while managing fluctuating kin relations and preparing for uncertain futures.",2018,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Aspirations,11

Twenty in-depth interviews were conducted with respondents in the offender sample. The study revealed initial evidence of common aspirations across respondents in both samples and found similarities in ideas of what constitutes a good life.

Drawing on empirical evidence collected through qualitative research in the northeast of Brazil, it traces notions of intergenerational change and continuity amongst young recipients of the Bolsa Família programme (BFP) and their families. It argues that the BFP has contributed to raising expectations and aspirations of social mobility, through a policy narrative that explicitly links education to poverty reduction alongside some relatively limited but nonetheless significant intergenerational changes in material conditions and access to education. However, rising aspirations have not been matched by a concomitant expansion of opportunities available to poor young people in education and the labour market. The article thus highlights the contradictions that arise between policy narratives, the aspirations these narratives engender, and the realities of young people's everyday lives.",2022,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Aspirations,6
10.3390/su12083359,Mapping the Sustainable Development Goals Relationships,,"Sustainable development addresses humanity’s aspiration for a better life while observing the limitations imposed by nature. In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly approved the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the aim to foster the organizational operationalization and integration of sustainability and, therefore, to address the current and forthcoming stakeholder needs and ensure a better and sustainable future for all, balancing the economic, social, and environmental development. However, it is not entirely clear which are the mutual relationships among the 17 SDGs and this study aims to tackle this research gap. The results of the correlation confirm that Poverty elimination (SDG1) and Good health and well-being (SDG3) have synergetic relationships with most of the other goals. SDG7 (Affordable and clean energy) has significant relationships with other SDGs (e.g., SDG1 (No poverty), SDG2 (Zero hunger), SDG3 (Good health and well-being), SDG8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG13 (Climate action)). However, there is a moderate negative correlation with SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production), which emphasizes the need to improve energy efficiency, increase the share of clean and renewable energies and improve sustainable consumption patterns worldwide. There is also confirmation that SDG12 (Responsible consumption and production) is the goal strongly associated with trade-offs. To sum up, this research suggests that change towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals offers many opportunities for reinforcing rather than inhibiting itself. However, some SDGs show no significant correlation with other SDGs (e.g., SDG13 (Climate action) and SDG17 (Partnerships for the goals), which highlights the need for future research.",2020,Openalex,Beliefs,Poverty and Aspirations,420
10.1126/science.1238041,Poverty Impedes Cognitive Function,,"The poor often behave in less capable ways, which can further perpetuate poverty. We hypothesize that poverty directly impedes cognitive function and present two studies that test this hypothesis. First, we experimentally induced thoughts about finances and found that this reduces cognitive performance among poor but not in well-off participants. Second, we examined the cognitive function of farmers over the planting cycle. We found that the same farmer shows diminished cognitive performance before harvest, when poor, as compared with after harvest, when rich. This cannot be explained by differences in time available, nutrition, or work effort. Nor can it be explained with stress: Although farmers do show more stress before harvest, that does not account for diminished cognitive performance. Instead, it appears that poverty itself reduces cognitive capacity. We suggest that this is because poverty-related concerns consume mental resources, leaving less for other tasks. These data provide a previously unexamined perspective and help explain a spectrum of behaviors among the poor. We discuss some implications for poverty policy.",2013,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive function,2499

10.1017/s0954579401003133,Can poverty get under your skin? Basal cortisol levels and cognitive function in children from low and high socioeconomic status,,"It is well known that individuals from more advantaged social classes enjoy better mental and physical health than do individuals within lower classes. Various mechanisms have been evoked to explain the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and health. One mechanism that has received particular attention in recent years is stress. It has been shown that individuals lower in SES report greater exposure to stressful life events and a greater impact of these events on their life than individuals higher in SES. In order to measure whether the development of the relationship between SES and mental health is sustained by exposure to high levels of glucocorticoids, we measured morning salivary cortisol levels as well as cognitive function (memory, attention, and language) in 307 children (from 6 to 16 years of age) from low versus high SES in the Montreal area in Canada. The results revealed that low SES children from 6 to 10 years old present significantly higher salivary cortisol levels when compared to children from high SES. This difference disappears at the time of school transition, and no SES differences are observed in salivary cortisol levels during high school. However, children from low and high SES do not differ with regard to memory or to attentional and linguistic functions. Also, mothers of low SES children reported higher feelings of depression and more unhealthy behaviors, while mothers of high SES children reported higher stress related to work or family transitions. Altogether, these results show that low SES in young children is related to increased cortisol secretion, although the impact of SES on cortisol secretion is absent after transition to high school. These data are interpreted within the context of the equalization process of class patterning. Four social explanatory factors are suggested to explain the disappearance of SES differences in basal cortisol levels after school transition, taking into account the influence of family environment on the child's secretion of stress hormones.",2001,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive function,586
10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.23774,"Assessment of Neighborhood Poverty, Cognitive Function, and Prefrontal and Hippocampal Volumes in Children",,"<h3>Importance</h3> The association between poverty and unfavorable cognitive outcomes is robust, but most research has focused on individual household socioeconomic status (SES). There is increasing evidence that neighborhood context explains unique variance not accounted for by household SES. <h3>Objective</h3> To evaluate whether neighborhood poverty (NP) is associated with cognitive function and prefrontal and hippocampal brain structure in ways that are dissociable from household SES. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This cross-sectional study used a baseline sample of the ongoing longitudinal Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. The ABCD Study will follow participants for assessments each year for 10 years. Data were collected at 21 US sites, mostly within urban and suburban areas, between September 2019 and October 2018. School-based recruitment was used to create a participant sample reflecting the US population. Data analysis was conducted from March to June 2019. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> NP and household SES were included as factors potentially associated with National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognitive Battery subtests and hippocampal and prefrontal (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC], dorsomedial PFC [DMPFC], superior frontal gyrus [SFG]) volumes. Independent variables were first considered individually and then together in mixed-effects models with age, sex, and intracranial volume as covariates. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to assess shared variance in NP to brain structure and cognitive task associations. The tested hypotheses were formulated after data collection. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 11 875 children aged 9 and 10 years (5678 [47.8%] girls) were analyzed. Greater NP was associated with lower scores across all cognitive domains (eg, total composite: β = −0.18; 95% CI, −0.21 to −0.15;<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and with decreased brain volume in the DLPFC (eg, right DLPFC: β = −0.09; 95% CI, −0.12 to −0.07;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), DMPFC (eg, right DMPC: β = −0.07; 95% CI, −0.09 to −0.05;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), SFG (eg, right SFG: β = −0.05; 95% CI, −0.08 to −0.03;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), and right hippocampus (β = −0.04; 95% CI, −0.06 to −0.01;<i>P</i> = .01), even when accounting for household income. Greater household income was associated with higher scores across all cognitive domains (eg, total composite: β = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.33;<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and larger volume in all prefrontal and hippocampal brain regions (eg, right hippocampus: β = 0.04; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.07;<i>P</i> &lt; .001) even when accounting for NP. The SEM model was a good fit across all cognitive domains, with prefrontal regions being associated with NP relations to language (picture vocabulary: estimate [SE], –0.03 [0.01];<i>P</i> &lt; .001; oral reading: estimate [SE], –0.02 [0.01];<i>P</i> &lt; .001), episodic memory (picture sequence: estimate [SE], –0.02 [0.01];<i>P</i> = .008), and working memory (dimensional card sort: estimate [SE], –0.02 [0.01];<i>P</i> = .001; flanker inhibitory control: estimate [SE], –0.01 [0.01];<i>P</i> = .01; list sorting: estimate [SE], –0.03 [0.01];<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and hippocampal regions being associated with NP associations with language (picture vocabulary: estimate [SE], –0.01 [0.004];<i>P</i> &lt; .001) and episodic memory (picture sequence: estimate [SE], –0.01 [0.004];<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> In this study, NP accounted for unique variance in cognitive function and prefrontal and right hippocampal brain volume.

Duration of poverty, defined according to urban and rural regional standards from the China Statistical Yearbook, was assessed according to annual household income from 2005 to 2011 (never in poverty; one-third of the period in poverty; two-thirds or more of the period in poverty). Cognitive function was measured by the Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination (CMMSE) from 2011 to 2018. We used attrition-weighted, multivariable mixed-effects Tobit regression to examine the association of duration of poverty with cognitive function and rate of decline.A total of 1,162 individuals (36.21%) were never in poverty over the period from 2005 to 2011; 1,172 (36.52%) were in poverty one-third of the period; and 875 (27.27%) were in poverty two-thirds or more of the period. A longer poverty duration was associated with lower subsequent CMMSE scores with a dose-response relationship (one-third vs never in poverty: β = -0.98; 95% confidence interval -1.61 to -0.35; two-thirds or more vs never in poverty: β = -1.55; 95% confidence interval -2.29 to -0.81). However, a longer duration of poverty was associated with a slower rate of CMMSE score decline over time from 2011 to 2018.These findings provide valuable evidence for the role of cumulative late-life poverty in relation to cognitive health among older adults in a rapidly urbanizing and aging middle-income country.

10.1371/journal.pone.0278618,Associations between early childhood poverty and cognitive functioning throughout childhood and adolescence: A 14-year prospective longitudinal analysis of the Mauritius Child Health Project,,"Associations between childhood poverty and cognitive outcomes have been examined from multiple perspectives. However, most evidence is based on cross-sectional data or longitudinal data covering only segments of the developmental process. Moreover, previous longitudinal research has mostly relied on data from Western nations, limiting insights of poverty dynamics in low- and middle-income countries. Here, we use data from the Mauritius Child Health Project, a large-scale prospective longitudinal study conducted in a then low-income country, to examine long-term associations between poverty in early childhood and cognitive performance across childhood and adolescence. Poverty-related factors were assessed at age 3 years and comprised indicators of psychosocial adversity and malnutrition. Cognitive functioning was assessed at ages 3 and 11 years by using standardized intelligence measures and at age 17 years by means of a computerized test battery. Using multiple hierarchical regression models, we found that chronic malnutrition and parental characteristics showed similar-sized, independent associations with initial cognitive functioning at age 3 as well as at age 11 years. For age 17 years, however, associations with early childhood risk factors vanished and instead, cognitive functioning was predicted by performance on prior cognitive assessments. Sex was also found to be a powerful predictor of cognitive trajectories, with boys improving and girls worsening over time, regardless of the level of their initial exposure to risk. The current findings indicate that, to prevent cognitive impairment, interventions tackling poverty and malnutrition should focus on the infancy period and be designed in a gender-sensitive way.",2023,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive function,4

In particular, it tests the relative role of family economic hardship compared with family instability in affecting cognitive functioning at the age of 5 years. <h3>Methods</h3> The study draws on data from the UK Millennium Cohort, linking data collected in infancy, age 3, and age 5 years. Cognitive ability was directly assessed at age 5 years with the British Ability Scales. Using regression models we examine associations between persistent income poverty, family transitions, and children9s cognitive ability, controlling for family demographics and housing conditions, as well as child characteristics. <h3>Results</h3> The findings suggest that the experience of persistent economic hardship as well as very early poverty undermines cognitive functioning at 5 years of age. Family instability shows no significant association with cognitive functioning after controlling for family poverty, family demographics, housing and a set of control variables indicating child characteristics. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Persistent poverty is a crucial risk factor undermining children9s cognitive development—more so than family instability.",2011,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive function,112

Structured questionnaires were used to assess demographic and socioeconomic status of the participants.Twenty-six percent of the participants were undernourished, and 62% were at risk of malnutrition according to the MNA. The MNA scores were significantly lower in women than in men (P=.01). Women performed worse than men in all three cognitive tasks (P<.001). Poorer cognitive performance was independently associated with older age, female sex, illiteracy, visual impairment, severity of disease, and depressive symptoms.

Our analysis provided little support for the idea that an early intervention to support household income has a larger effect than intervention later in childhood; both seemed equally important. We also decomposed the effect of poverty at age <7 years into direct and indirect effects mediated through poverty and schooling/home environment at age 7-14 years. For decomposing the effects, we used 3 approaches: 1) joint mediators, 2) path-specific, and 3) intervention analog.

The emissions include a myriad of toxic air pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the most important human-produced climate-altering greenhouse gas. Synergies between air pollution and climate change can magnify the harm to children. Impacts include impairment of cognitive and behavioral development, respiratory illness, and other chronic diseases—all of which may be “seeded“ in utero and affect health and functioning immediately and over the life course. By impairing children’s health, ability to learn, and potential to contribute to society, pollution and climate change cause children to become less resilient and the communities they live in to become less equitable. The developing fetus and young child are disproportionately affected by these exposures because of their immature defense mechanisms and rapid development, especially those in low- and middle-income countries where poverty and lack of resources compound the effects. No country is spared, however: even high-income countries, especially low-income communities and communities of color within them, are experiencing impacts of fossil fuel-related pollution, climate change and resultant widening inequality and environmental injustice. Global pediatric health is at a tipping point, with catastrophic consequences in the absence of bold action. Fortunately, technologies and interventions are at hand to reduce and prevent pollution and climate change, with large economic benefits documented or predicted.

Aspects of cognitive functioning, such as information processing, may underlie these kinds of problems. How might poverty affect the brain functions underlying these cognitive processes? Here, we address this question by observing and analyzing repeated measures of brain development of young children between five months and four years of age from economically diverse backgrounds (n = 77). In doing so, we have the opportunity to observe changes in brain growth as children begin to experience the effects of poverty. These children underwent MRI scanning, with subjects completing between 1 and 7 scans longitudinally. Two hundred and three MRI scans were divided into different tissue types using a novel image processing algorithm specifically designed to analyze brain data from young infants. Total gray, white, and cerebral (summation of total gray and white matter) volumes were examined along with volumes of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. Infants from low-income families had lower volumes of gray matter, tissue critical for processing of information and execution of actions. These differences were found for both the frontal and parietal lobes. No differences were detected in white matter, temporal lobe volumes, or occipital lobe volumes.

10.1093/sf/77.1.257,The Timing of the Influences of Cumulative Poverty on Children's Cognitive Ability and Achievement,,"Is childhood such a critical period that, by the end of this period, cumulative poverty would have exerted maximum effect on children's cognitive outcomes? Or are cognitive outcomes more a function of the length of exposure to poverty regardless of the life stage in which the child is exposed to poverty? The NLSY, which measures each child's cognitive development repeatedly over time, was analyzed to answer these questions. We distinguish between ability and achievement. Ability is a more stable trait than achievement and tends to be determined by both environmental and genetic factors early in life. Achievement on the other hand is more acquired. This study shows that long-term poverty has substantial influences on both ability and achievement, but the time patterns of these influences are distinctly different. Childhood appears to be a much more crucial period for the development of cognitive ability than early adolescence. In contrast, poverty experienced in adolescence appears to be more influential to adolescent achievement than poverty experienced earlier in life.",1998,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive function,186

Only 26 children were identified as functioning in the normal range for cognitive, social/adaptive, health, and growth parameters at age 3. These children, who showed early signs of resiliency, differed from nonresilient children in that they were receiving more responsive, accepting, stimulating, and organized care. They were also living in safer, less crowded homes. 6 ""protective"" aspects of caregiving were identified and used as part of a cumulative protection index. Children with less than 3 protective aspects of caregiving present at age 1 had only a 2% probability of being resilient, and only a 6% probability if fewer than 3 were present at age 3. Overall, premature LBW children born into conditions of poverty have a very poor prognosis of functioning within normal ranges across all the dimensions of health and development assessed. However, those raised in a setting with 3 or more protective factors were more likely to show early signs of resiliency.",1994,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive function,301

Temporal changes and instability in family processes, but not income, predicted children's adjustment. Cross-sectional mediational analyses indicated that for families living at the poverty threshold, family processes fully mediated the effect of average income over the study period on social behavior but only partially mediated its effect on cognitive-linguistic development. The strength of these associations diminished as average income exceeded the poverty threshold. That is, income had a greater impact on the family functioning and development of poor children than of nonpoor children.",2004,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive function,233

In the study reported here, 40 Portuguese-Luxembourgish bilingual children from low-income immigrant families in Luxembourg and 40 matched monolingual children from Portugal completed visuospatial tests of working memory, abstract reasoning, selective attention, and interference suppression. Two broad cognitive factors of executive functioning—representation (abstract reasoning and working memory) and control (selective attention and interference suppression)—emerged from principal component analysis. Whereas there were no group differences in representation, the bilinguals performed significantly better than did the monolinguals in control. These results demonstrate, first, that the bilingual advantage is neither confounded with nor limited by socioeconomic and cultural factors and, second, that separable aspects of executive functioning are differentially affected by bilingualism. The bilingual advantage lies in control but not in visuospatial representational processes.",2012,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive function,267

Data (N = 1,307) were combined to accrue a sufficient number of children who attended high-quality child-care centers who were from impoverished families or minority ethnic backgrounds to reliably compare their developmental outcomes with those of children in poorer quality care. Children's behavior, language skills, and preacademic skills were analyzed as a function of child-care quality (low-, medium-, and high-quality groups based on the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale total scores), background risk factors, and parental attitudes to test hypotheses about risk and protective factors. Results provide further support for the hypothesis that quality of child care is related to children's development for all children and quite limited support that child-care quality may matter more for children experiencing social risk factors. Language development was the only outcome in which child-care quality interacted with a risk variable, ethnicity, suggesting that quality of care is differentially more important for language development for children of color than for White-non-Hispanic children.",2000,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive function,284

We assessed a nationally representative sample of 3–6‐year‐old children (n = 1332) from 150 communities of Madagascar using standard tests of development. We found that children whose families were in the top wealth quintile or whose mothers had secondary education performed significantly better across almost all measures of cognitive and language development and had better linear growth compared with children of women in the lowest wealth quintile or women with no education. These differences between children of low and high socioeconomic position were greatest for receptive language, working memory, and memory of phrases. The mean difference in the scores between children in the highest and lowest socioeconomic status categories doubled between age 3 and age 6, and the biggest gaps across socioeconomic position by age 6 were in receptive language and sustained attention. Our results suggest that even within the context of extreme poverty, there are strong associations between family socioeconomic status and child development outcomes among preschool children, and that the language and executive function domains exhibit the largest gradients.",2011,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive function,207

We hypothesize that chronic debt impairs psychological functioning and decision-making, contributing to the poverty trap. This is because debt is not considered fungible and is viewed as costly mental accounts that consume cognitive bandwidth. We test this using quasiexperimental evidence from a one-off, unanticipated debt-relief program worth several months’ household income. Comparing the poor before and after debt relief, those with more debt accounts paid off experienced greater improvements in cognitive functioning, reported less anxiety, and became less present-biased. These findings provide actionable evidence for poverty-alleviation policy.",2019,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive function,110

However, these long term effects were mostly explained by the effects of adversity on childhood or adolescent cognitive ability or by differences in educational attainment and adult social class. An exception was the effect of poor material home conditions on visual search speed at 53 years, which was maintained after controlling for adolescent ability, as well as further control for educational attainment, adult social class, physical growth, cigarette smoking, and affective state. There was no evidence of more rapid decline in memory and psychomotor function across middle age in those exposed to early adversity. <b>Conclusions:</b> The effect of early adversity on cognitive function tracks across the life course at least as far as middle age, although there was little evidence from this study of effect amplification over this interval.

The results of past prospective studies, when carefully examined, do not consistently support this hypothesis. In the current study, the authors used symptom and neurocognitive data to predict subsequent level of functioning in the community.Neurocognitive and symptom data collected as part of an earlier study were used to predict the community functioning of 50 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Using the Life Skills Profile, staff of a community mental health program assessed community functioning while blind to the earlier symptom ratings and neurocognitive performance.Symptoms were more predictive of community functioning than were neurocognitive measures. Disorganization symptoms were generally more predictive of community functioning than was either psychomotor poverty or reality distortion.The results of this study and of previous longitudinal studies suggest the importance of using symptom levels after optimal treatment, rather than symptoms during acute episodes, as predictors of community functioning. They also indicate the need to evaluate the effects of treatment on disorganization as a separable dimension of symptoms.",1999,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive function,160

10.1037/bul0000010,Cognitive aspects of young children’s experience of economic disadvantage.,,"Economic disadvantage is a well-studied risk factor for poorer behavioral and academic functioning in young children. Although the mechanisms by which disadvantage impacts children have long been of interest to researchers, studies to date have predominantly focused on mechanisms that are external to the child (e.g., parental depression, marital conflict). Very few studies have examined the internal, cognitive aspects of the experience of economic disadvantage, and almost none have considered how the effects of disadvantage on children's functioning might be mediated through cognitive processes. This article provides a framework for research into cognitive and social-cognitive mediators of economic disadvantage operating in early-to-middle childhood. The initial section of the article briefly reviews and summarizes the extant literature on childhood poverty and its effects. The second section reviews the evidence that preschool-aged children have the requisite cognitive abilities to recognize social inequality in their environments, to be aware of stereotypes related to social class, and to connect these social concepts to their own experience. The third section reviews and evaluates the small literature on children's appraisals, attributions, stereotypes, and perceptions of or about poverty and inequality. The fourth section defines and evaluates the literature on 2 social-cognitive processes-stereotype threat and status anxiety-that are hypothesized to mediate the effects of economic disadvantage on children's functioning. The article concludes with a series of proposed questions and hypotheses for future research, and elaborates on the potential implications of the proposed area of research.

10.2307/3089239,Meritocracy and Economic Inequality,,"Most Americans strongly favor equality of opportunity if not outcome, but many are weary of poverty's seeming immunity to public policy. This helps to explain the recent attention paid to cultural and genetic explanations of persistent poverty, including claims that economic inequality is a function of intellectual ability, as well as more subtle depictions of the United States as a meritocracy where barriers to achievement are personal--either voluntary or inherited--rather than systemic. This volume of original essays by luminaries in the economic, social, and biological sciences, however, confirms mounting evidence that the connection between intelligence and inequality is surprisingly weak and demonstrates that targeted educational and economic reforms can reduce the income gap and improve the country's aggregate productivity and economic well-being. It also offers a novel agenda of equal access to valuable associations.Amartya Sen, John Roemer, Robert M. Hauser, Glenn Loury, Orley Ashenfelter, and others sift and analyze the latest arguments and quantitative findings on equality in order to explain how merit is and should be defined, how economic rewards are distributed, and how patterns of economic success persist across generations. Moving well beyond exploration, they draw specific conclusions that are bold yet empirically grounded, finding that schooling improves occupational success in ways unrelated to cognitive ability, that IQ is not a strong independent predictor of economic success, and that people's associations--their neighborhoods, working groups, and other social ties--significantly explain many of the poverty traps we observe.The optimistic message of this beautifully edited book is that important violations of equality of opportunity do exist but can be attenuated by policies that will serve the general economy. Policy makers will read with interest concrete suggestions for crafting economically beneficial anti-discrimination measures, enhancing educational and associational opportunity, and centering economic reforms in community-based institutions.

Limited longitudinal research has been conducted on the impact of neglect on children’s health and well-being. There is a need to consider the impact of specific subtypes of neglect on children’s functioning. In addition, there is interest in examining the cumulative effect of experiencing &amp;gt;1 subtype of neglect. Objective. To examine the individual and cumulative relationships among physical, psychological, and environmental neglect and children’s behavior and development at age 3, and the impact on changes in children’s behavior and development between ages 3 and 5. Methods. One hundred thirty-six children and their primary caregivers participating in a prospective longitudinal study of children’s development and maltreatment were assessed when the children were aged 3 and 5 years. The children were recruited from primary care clinics because of failure to thrive, risk for human immunodeficiency virus, or as a comparison group. Evaluations were conducted in laboratory and home settings using observations, maternal self-report, and standardized testing of the children. Scores on physical, psychological, and environmental neglect were combined into a Cumulative Neglect Index. Regression analyses were run to examine the association of specific subtypes of neglect and of cumulative neglect with children’s functioning at age 3, controlling for group, sociodemographic risk, and maternal depression. The analyses were repeated examining the impact on child outcomes at age 5, controlling for the above 3 variables as well as the children’s cognitive development and behavior at age 3. Results. Of the subtypes of neglect at age 3, only psychological neglect was significantly associated with increased internalizing and externalizing behavior problems at age 3; the Cumulative Neglect Index was associated with internalizing problems. None of the neglect subtypes or cumulative neglect were predictive of changes in children’s behavior and development between ages 3 and 5. Cognitive development of the entire sample was impaired at age 5, averaging 0.85 standard deviations below the norm, and their average externalizing behavior score was significantly problematic with an average of 0.60 standard deviations above the norm. Conclusions. In the context of poverty where many preschool children have poor cognitive development and increased behavior problems, psychological neglect is significantly related to reported behavior problems. Children who experienced multiple types of neglect had increased internalizing problems. Neglect did not explain changes in children’s behavior or development between ages 3 and 5. There is a need for pediatricians to identify and address child neglect, particularly psychological neglect, as early as possible. Pediatricians should also screen for maternal depression.",2002,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive function,162

Our analysis uses data from an experiment, which randomly assigned low-income individuals to perform a cognitive test before or after payday. On average, and based on traditional subgroup analysis, the experiment did not suggest that the poorer financial circumstances before payday impeded cognitive function.

Even if children's reading skills seem to be related to their socioeconomic status, only a few studies have examined how SES is related to the development of reading skills in children facing severe poverty. This study traced 322 Roma children facing severe poverty from 7 through 9 years and compared them with an unselected sample of 178 Romanian non-Roma children. The Roma children had both poorer initial reading and a slower growth of their reading skills. In contrast to previous studies, SES did explain growth in reading skills after controlling for other well-known cognitive and linguistic predictors of reading. Among the Roma children, the effects of SES on reading growth were partly mediated by school absence. Thus, interventions directed at Roma children facing severe poverty need to target both the quality of reading instruction and broader aspects of these children's lives.",2019,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognition,80

Given high levels of racial segregation and elevated rates of Black poverty, it is axiomatically true that African Americans will experience more neighborhood poverty than other groups. Moreover, because poverty is associated with crime and delinquency, they will also be exposed to far higher rates of social disorder and violence. In this article I argue that long-term exposure to social disorder and violence because of segregation produces a high allostatic load among African Americans, which leads, in turn, to a variety of deleterious health and cognitive outcomes. After summarizing recent research on stress and allostatic load, I specify a biosocial model of racial stratification and draw upon it to explicate well-documented racial differentials with respect to health and cognition.",2004,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognition,336

We find that in utero exposure to elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol negatively affects offspring cognition, health, and educational attainment. These findings are based on comparisons between siblings that limit variation to short-lived shocks and controls for unobserved differences between mothers that could bias estimates. Our results are consistent with recent experimental results in the neurobiological literature linking exogenous exposure to stress hormones in utero with declines in offspring cognitive, behavioral, and motor development. Moreover, we find that not only are mothers with low levels of human capital characterized by higher and more variable cortisol levels but that the negative impact of elevated cortisol on their offspring is greater.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between cognitive function, symptoms and quality of life (QOL) in schizophrenia. Method: This cross-sectional study measured cognition, positive and negative symptom severity, and quality of life (measured with the Quality of Life Scale) in 57 outpatients with schizophrenia. Correlations between the different measures were sought. Multiple regression analyses were used to develop models of the contributions of cognitive deficits and symptomatology to QOL. Results: More severe positive and negative symptoms and cognitive impairment each correlated with poorer QOL. There was a moderate association between negative symptoms and cognition and a small association between positive symptoms and cognition. Age, gender, and drug and alcohol abuse did not significantly predict QOL. In the multiple regression analysis, entering the total cognition and total symptom scores produced a model that accounted for an additional 57% of the variance in QOL. Conclusions: Improving quality of life for people with schizophrenia requires that positive and negative symptoms and cognition are each addressed as separate domains of impairment. But, given that these account for only 57% of the variance in QOL, other factors such as unemployment, poverty, social isolation and stigma may also be important.",2008,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognition,103

This article examines the impact of Legacy on children's cognitive and language development (intelligence quotient [IQ], achievement, language skills, and early reading skills) using both standardized assessments and parent-reported indictors through third grade. Methods: Data were collected from 2001 to 2014 from 541 mother-child dyads who were recruited into the 2 concurrent randomized controlled trials of Legacy in Miami and Los Angels. Cognitive and/or language outcomes of children were assessed annually from age 2 to 5 years as well as during a follow-up visit in the third grade. Results: Children experiencing Legacy at the Los Angeles site had significantly higher IQ and achievement scores at 2 and 6 years postintervention, equivalent to approximately one-third of an SD (4 IQ points). IQ results persisted over time, and the difference between intervention and comparison groups on achievement scores widened. There were no significant differences in cognitive outcomes in the Miami sample. There were no significant differences in language outcomes for either site. Conclusion: Legacy shows evidence of effectiveness as an intervention to prevent cognitive delays among children living in poverty. The mixed findings across sites may not only reflect the impact of heterogeneous risk profiles noted by other intervention research programs but also warrant additional study.",2019,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognition,5

However, the relative contributions of the various SES factors on brain development and the mediating effects between cognition and brain morphometry have not been investigated. Here we used cross-sectional data from the ABCD Study to evaluate associations among various SES and demographic factors, brain morphometrics, and cognition and their reproducibility in two independent subsamples of 3892 children. Among the SES factors, family income (FI) best explained individual differences in cognitive test scores (stronger for crystallized than for fluid cognition), cortical volume (CV), and thickness (CT). Other SES factors that showed significant associations with cognition and brain morphometrics included parental education and neighborhood deprivation, but when controlling for FI, their effect sizes were negligible and their regional brain patterns were not reproducible. Mediation analyses showed that cognitive scores, which we used as surrogate markers of the children's level of cognitive stimulation, partially mediated the association of FI and CT, whereas the mediations of brain morphometrics on the association of FI and cognition were not significant. These results suggest that lack of supportive/educational stimulation in children from low-income families might drive the reduced CV and CT. Thus, strategies to enhance parental supportive stimulation and the quality of education for children in low-income families could help counteract the negative effects of poverty on children's brain development.",2021,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognition,88

Dispositional attributions were expected to be linked to the withholding of personal donations to overseas aid. A combined total of 582 undergraduates from the University of Malawi (n = 251) and the University of Newcastle in Australia (n = 331) completed the Causes of Third World Poverty Questionnaire, which measures one dispositional factor (Blame the Poor) and three situational factors (Nature, National Governments, and International Exploitation). Strong advocates of donation behavior made the least dispositional attributions, but Malawians blamed dispositions more than did Australians, who blamed situations more than did Malawians. This reversed observer-actor bias underscores the critical influence of community context over societal culture and indicates that social cognition may be relevant to international aid efforts.",1998,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognition,74
10.1016/j.euroneuro.2014.03.008,"Negative symptoms of schizophrenia: Clinical characteristics, pathophysiological substrates, experimental models and prospects for improved treatment",,"Schizophrenia is a complex and multifactorial disorder generally diagnosed in young adults at the time of the first psychotic episode of delusions and hallucinations. These positive symptoms can be controlled in most patients by currently-available antipsychotics. Conversely, they are poorly effective against concomitant neurocognitive dysfunction, deficits in social cognition and negative symptoms (NS), which strongly contribute to poor functional outcome. The precise notion of NS has evolved over the past century, with recent studies – underpinned by novel rating methods – suggesting two major sub-domains: “decreased emotional expression”, incorporating blunted affect and poverty of speech, and “avolition”, which embraces amotivation, asociality and “anhedonia” (inability to anticipate pleasure). Recent studies implicate a dysfunction of frontocortico-temporal networks in the aetiology of NS, together with a disruption of cortico-striatal circuits, though other structures are also involved, like the insular and parietal cortices, amygdala and thalamus. At the cellular level, a disruption of GABAergic–glutamatergic balance, dopaminergic signalling and, possibly, oxytocinergic and cannibinoidergic transmission may be involved. Several agents are currently under clinical investigation for the potentially improved control of NS, including oxytocin itself, N-Methyl-d-Aspartate receptor modulators and minocycline. Further, magnetic-electrical “stimulation” strategies to recruit cortical circuits and “cognitive–behavioural–psychosocial” therapies likewise hold promise. To acquire novel insights into the causes and treatment of NS, experimental study is crucial, and opportunities are emerging for improved genetic, pharmacological and developmental modelling, together with more refined readouts related to deficits in reward, sociality and “expression”. The present article comprises an integrative overview of the above issues as a platform for this Special Issue of European Neuropsychopharmacology in which five clinical and five preclinical articles treat individual themes in greater detail. This Volume provides, then, a framework for progress in the understanding – and ultimately control – of the debilitating NS of schizophrenia.",2014,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognition,300

The prevalence rate of cognitive development problem in Bhutan is 15%, 33.5% of children less than five years are stunted and 9.9% of infants are born with low weight of less than 2,500 grams. Five main factors identified in contributing to growth and developments at early childhood are nutrition, parent’s behaviours, parenting, social and cultural practices, and environment. Understanding the extent and magnitude of these problems especially within 1000 days of child includes from the date of conception till the child attends 2 years of age is very important. If timely interventions are taken within this critical period, the problems are reversible and will gain maximum benefits. A healthy child especially within this age will have better cognition and learning capabilities, and consequently have impact on social, economic, physical and cognition. Therefore, healthy children within 1000 days will lay the foundation for nurturing bright school children, healthy and productive adulthood thus will promote Gross National Happiness of the country.",2016,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognition,87

The purpose of this work was to determine cognitive and adaptive behavioral outcomes of children with traumatic brain injury acquired before age 2 years and to compare outcomes between inflicted versus noninflicted brain injury. PATIENTS AND METHODS. All North Carolina children hospitalized in an ICU for a traumatic brain injury before age 2 years between the years 2000 and 2001 were eligible for study entry. A total of 112 surviving children were prospectively identified, 52 (46%) of whom had complete follow-up. Thirty-one control children were recruited from preschool settings. Control subjects were chosen to be demographically similar to case subjects. Child measures of cognition and adaptive behavior at age 3 years were measured and compared between children with and without traumatic brain injury and children with inflicted and noninflicted traumatic brain injury. RESULTS. Sixty percent of injured children were &amp;gt;1 SD below normal on cognitive testing. Forty percent of injured children scored &amp;gt;1 SD below normal on adaptive behavior testing. Children with inflicted traumatic brain injury performed more poorly on tests of cognition and adaptive behavior. Glasgow Coma Scale ≥13, absence of seizures, income above twice the poverty guidelines, and high social capital were associated with improved outcomes. Injured children had lower scores than uninjured control children after adjustment for socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS. Very young children with mild-to-severe traumatic brain injury as measured by the Glasgow Coma Scale are at risk for global cognitive deficits more than a year after the time of injury. Inflicted brain injury is associated with more severe injury and worse outcomes. This is less optimistic than findings in this same cohort 1 year after injury. Family characteristics seem to play a role in recovery after injury.",2007,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognition,125
10.1086/692290,China’s Invisible Crisis: Cognitive Delays among Rural Toddlers and the Absence of Modern Parenting,,"This article explores the problem of cognitive delays among toddlers in rural China and the role of their caregivers in producing low levels of cognition (i.e., low IQ). According to the results of a well-tested international scale of child development, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID), cognitive delays are alarmingly common, and nearly half the toddlers in our sample score an IQ of less than 84 on the BSID test (more than one standard deviation below the mean). In analyzing the source of this, we find that poor parenting—for example, not reading to, singing with, or engaging in stimulating play with one’s children—is closely associated with these delays. Even though mothers (as opposed to grandmother caregivers), and especially more educated mothers, are more likely to follow good parenting practices, quality parenting is rare overall. We seek to find out why so many young children appear to be neglected when it comes to modern parenting practices. We empirically rule out the hypotheses that caregivers discriminate according to their child’s gender; that the number of children in a given household is associated with the quality of parenting; or that caregivers living in relative poverty parent differently than their wealthier counterparts. According to the qualitative component of our study, we also find that inadequate parenting does not stem from parental indifference. Parents and grandparents obviously love their children and want them to succeed in life. Instead, the barriers appear to be primarily a lack of time and an absence of knowledge about the importance of good parenting practices. As a result, when they grow up, these children may not possess the levels of cognition needed to thrive in China’s increasingly high-skill-based economy. Overall, our findings suggest that China may be facing a national crisis due to inadequate rural early childhood development.",2017,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognition,111

We have shown that depressed mood and depressive cognition are not related to the negative syndrome, but there is some overlap between the specific phenomena of depressive illness and negative symptoms in schizophrenia. Items measuring cognitive impairment have a moderate correlation with the negative syndrome, but the negative syndrome accounts for less than half of the variance of cognitive performance. These items that define the negative syndrome can be as reliably measured as depressive and positive symptoms.",1993,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognition,98

We tested the hypothesis that receipt of supportive parenting would offset the association between living in poverty during adolescence and the connectivity of neural networks that support cognition and emotion regulation during young adulthood. In a sample of African American youths ( N = 119) living in the rural South, poverty status and receipt of supportive parenting were assessed when youths were 11 to 13 and 16 to 18 years old. At age 25, resting-state functional connectivity of the central-executive and emotion-regulation neural networks was assessed using functional MRI. The results revealed that more years spent living in poverty presaged less connectivity in both neural networks among young adults who received low levels of supportive parenting but not among those who received high levels of such parenting.",2019,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognition,74
10.1542/peds.2014-0694,Cognitive Deficit and Poverty in the First 5 Years of Childhood in Bangladesh,,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the timing and size of the cognitive deficit associated with poverty in the first 5 years of life and to examine the role of parental characteristics, pre- and postnatal growth, and stimulation in the home in Bangladeshi children. We hypothesized that the effect of poverty on cognition begins in infancy and is mainly mediated by these factors. METHODS: We enrolled 2853 singletons, a subsample from a pregnancy supplementation trial in a poor rural area. We assessed mental development at 7, 18, and 64 months; anthropometry at birth, 12, 24, and 64 months; home stimulation at 18 and 64 months; and family’s socioeconomic background. In multiple regression analyses, we examined the effect of poverty at birth on IQ at 64 months and the extent that other factors mediated the effect. RESULTS: A mean cognitive deficit of 0.2 (95% confidence interval –0.4 to –0.02) z scores between the first and fifth wealth quintiles was apparent at 7 months and increased to 1.2 (95% confidence interval –1.3 to –1.0) z scores of IQ by 64 months. Parental education, pre- and postnatal growth in length, and home stimulation mediated 86% of the effects of poverty on IQ and had independent effects. Growth in the first 2 years had larger effects than later growth. Home stimulation had effects throughout the period. CONCLUSIONS: Effects of poverty on children’s cognition are mostly mediated through parental education, birth size, growth in the first 24 months, and home stimulation in the first 5 years.",2014,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognition,11
10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00550,Executive functioning and reading achievement in school: a study of Brazilian children assessed by their teachers as â€œpoor readersâ€,,"This study examined executive functioning and reading achievement in 106 6- to 8-year-old Brazilian children from a range of social backgrounds of whom approximately half lived below the poverty line. A particular focus was to explore the executive function profile of children whose classroom reading performance was judged below standard by their teachers and who were matched to controls on chronological age, sex, school type (private or public), domicile (Salvador/BA or São Paulo/SP) and socioeconomic status. Children completed a battery of 12 executive function tasks that were conceptual tapping cognitive flexibility, working memory, inhibition and selective attention. Each executive function domain was assessed by several tasks. Principal component analysis extracted four factors that were labeled ""Working Memory/Cognitive Flexibility,"" ""Interference Suppression,"" ""Selective Attention,"" and ""Response Inhibition."" Individual differences in executive functioning components made differential contributions to early reading achievement. The Working Memory/Cognitive Flexibility factor emerged as the best predictor of reading. Group comparisons on computed factor scores showed that struggling readers displayed limitations in Working Memory/Cognitive Flexibility, but not in other executive function components, compared to more skilled readers. These results validate the account that working memory capacity provides a crucial building block for the development of early literacy skills and extends it to a population of early readers of Portuguese from Brazil. The study suggests that deficits in working memory/cognitive flexibility might represent one contributing factor to reading difficulties in early readers. This might have important implications for how educators might intervene with children at risk of academic under achievement.",2014,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,77

We examined cognitive performance and potential interactions of diet quality with race and poverty status using baseline data from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study. Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-2010) scores were calculated and interpreted using federal guidelines. A neurocognitive test battery was administered to evaluate cognitive function over several domains.Linear regression analyses showed that lower HEI-2010 scores were associated with poorer verbal learning and memory (P<0·05) after adjustment for covariates. Diet quality within the sample was poor. Significant interactions of HEI-2010 and poverty status (all P<0·05) indicated that higher diet quality was associated with higher performance on tests of attention and cognitive flexibility, visuospatial ability and perceptual speed among those below the poverty line. No significant race interactions emerged. Higher diet quality was associated with better performance on two measures of verbal learning and memory, irrespective of race and poverty status.Findings suggest that diet quality and cognitive function are likely related at the population level.

This circumstance has the potential to begin to reverse the enormous progress made by prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs, especially in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, where rates of maternal infection remain high. Interruptions to the vaccination schedule in early childhood could have short- and long-term ramifications for children's health. Furthermore, as has been experienced during the HIV epidemic, illness, hospitalization, separation, and loss of caregivers have immediate harmful effects on young children's health, nutrition, well-being, and learning. These effects can occur even in the absence of infection or symptoms among children. Deteriorating economic circumstances will further exacerbate immediate health, nutrition, care, and education risks. It is estimated that the pandemic can lead this year to an additional 42 to 66 million children who live in extreme poverty, and that the economic shocks experienced by families because of the global economic downturn could reverse the last 2 to 3 years of progress in decreasing infant mortality.8United Nations Policy brief: the impact of COVID-19 on children.https://unsdg.un.org/resources/policy-brief-impact-covid-19-childrenDate accessed: April 28, 2020Google Scholar Families may lose wages and housing, and have to bear the costs of increased health care and associated food insecurity.

For those household already living in conditions of adversity and stress, this crisis may have particularly harmful effects.

Socioeconomic inequalities at a global level are thus exacerbating the situation for millions of families. Furthermore, seasonal climate-related patterns (eg, monsoons) and other infectious diseases (eg, dengue, malaria, diarrhea) may deal further blows to those living in vulnerable geographic areas. These enduring and accentuated economic inequalities yield the potential for heightened societal discrimination, violence, and involuntary displacement. Evidence of the effectiveness of programs for families with young children—particularly those that assist caregivers, parents, and other household members—supports policies that can mitigate the severe short- and long-term impacts on young children of the COVID-19 pandemic. First, healthcare and economic relief are critical and must occur together. Emergency food provision should be accompanied by sustainable economic support (eg, through child benefits, increased cash transfers), because transfer-based social protection can benefit multiple domains of children's health and development.35Fernald L.C.

In the longer run, children at risk academically could be further disadvantaged if they do not have parents who can support their learning process at home. Therefore, media-based learning platforms should be accompanied by outreach to caregivers and parents. Third, the unique challenges of COVID-19 require further integration of family support with the realities of distancing, quarantine, isolation, and, in too many cases, loss. COVID-19-related awareness can accompany ECD awareness and supports for parental well-being and responsive caregiving. When distancing within households is indicated, separation of children from caregivers should only occur when absolutely necessary; when it does occur, communication between children and caregivers should be maintained as much as possible. For those households that experience loss of or serious illness in a caregiver, the approach to communicating this to children should build on evidence-based principles.58Stein A. Dalton L. Rapa E.

Children's understanding of illness and death evolves throughout childhood.59Dalton L. Rapa E. Stein A.

Sensitive and effective communication has considerable benefits for children and their family's long-term psychological well-being. Attention to the most vulnerable populations requires unprecedented coordination of these services, owing to these groups' even more challenging contexts.

10.2307/2657556,How Much Does Childhood Poverty Affect the Life Chances of Children?,,This study examines the impact of the level of income and the timing of economic deprivation in childhood on completed schooling in the US. Data were obtained from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics among a sample of 1323 children born during 1967 and 1973 and 328 sibling pairs. The average level of income increased across childhood. Income at ages 11-15 years was about 40% higher than income at ages 0-5 years. Only 39% of children with family incomes below $15000 in early childhood had incomes that low in adolescence. Almost 50% of siblings had 15-year average incomes that differed by over $5000. Multivariate analysis reveals that children with family incomes of $15000-25000 completed .82 years more schooling had 4.1 times greater odds of completing high school and had an insignificantly lower risk of a nonmarital birth. At the next higher income level children had a half a year higher schooling level than children with income of $15000-25000. A $10000 increase to income averaged over the 0-5 years of life for children in low-income families was associated with a .81 year increase in completed schooling and a 2.9 times increase in the odds of finishing high school. These estimated effects were larger than at ages 6-10 years and 11-15 years. Parental income during adolescence was less important in the completion of high school and more important for college decisions. Children with early childhood family incomes of $15000-25000 averaged .66 years more schooling than children in the lowest income group. Stage-specific income from all childhood stages did not strongly predict nonmarital childbearing. High income during adolescence enabled children to enter college but did not predict completion of college. Sibling findings supported the individual-based findings that economic conditions in early childhood particularly among low-income families were key determinants of completed schooling.,1998,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,1616

Guided by the polyvagal perspective, we tested whether children's VRC is associated with attenuated sympathetic nervous system (SNS) stress reactivity in socially supportive conditions. Sixty-one 4- to 5-year-old children living in poverty underwent two standardized laboratory stress induction procedures. Cardiac vagal reactivity (respiratory sinus arrhythmia) to a first set of stressors (social, cognitive, physical, and emotional) indexed VRC. During a second set of stressors, participants were randomly assigned to a supportive or nonsupportive social context, and cardiac sympathetic reactivity (preejection period) was assessed. We hypothesized VRC would predict lower SNS stress reactivity, but only in the socially supportive context. Children with high VRC showed attenuated SNS stress reactivity in the socially supportive context compared to children with high VRC in the nonsupportive context and children with low VRC in either context. Individual differences in VRC predict attenuated SNS stress reactivity in socially supportive conditions. Understanding how social support and VRC jointly mitigate SNS stress reactivity may further efforts to prevent negative health outcomes.

At the same time, a micro literature has typically found positive correlations between individual income and individual measures of subjective well-being. This paper suggests that these two findings are consistent with the presence of relative income terms in the utility function. Income may be evaluated relative to others (social comparison) or to oneself in the past (habituation). We review the evidence on relative income from the subjective well-being literature. We also discuss the relation (or not) between happiness and utility, and discuss some nonhappiness research (behavioral, experimental, neurological) related to income comparisons. We last consider how relative income in the utility function can affect economic models of behavior in the domains of consumption, investment, economic growth, savings, taxation, labor supply, wages, and migration.

This two-volume study of the effects of poor urban neighborhoods on families makes a stimulating contribution to related theory, research, public policies, and programs. Its emphasis on human development in an ecological context is part of a welcome and growing trend. See, for example, Phyllis Moen, Glen H. Elder, and Kurt Luscher (1955), and Greg J. Duncan and Jeanne Brooks-Gunn (1977). The contents of the present volumes are so rich that it is impossible to do justice to them here. Volume I is chiefly a report and discussion of large, multidisciplinary studies of neighborhood and influences on the cognitive, behavioral, and educational outcomes of children and adolescents at various stages of their development. It also includes chapters on conceptual issues and implications of findings for federal policies. Volume II explores theories about poverty, urban ecology, research methods, public policies, and programs at state and local levels. These books were developed under the auspices of the Social Science Research Council. Further funding was provided by a number of foundations. The project's goal was to establish a research program to improve understanding of the causes and consequences of persistent, concentrated poverty and to build a base for the design and implementation of better policies and programs. The multidisciplinary research group of social scientists came from a variety of universities. The undertaking was sparked by the work of Urie Bronfenbrenner (1979) and by W. J. Wilson's book (1987) on the severe effects of urban poverty on neighborhoods. The group, in an extensive review of past research, concluded that the research showed only weak and inconsistent evidence of the effects of neighborhood composition on individual outcomes. It decided, therefore, to attempt to develop new theory, concepts, methods, and empirical findings that would guide further research. A variety of analyses of six existing data sets were carried out. Three of these sets included national, longitudinal data-the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the National Longitudinal Study of Youth, and the Infant Health and Development Program. The other three sets were more local in nature. All included Black, White, and Hispanic participants. Census data provided information about neighborhoods, including socioeconomic levels of the population, ethnic diversity, rates of male joblessness, and family concentration. Important information not available included community resources such as schools and social services. Rates of crime and housing characteristics also were not provided. The authors comment at length on the inadequacy of census tract data for a true understanding of neighborhoods. However, the data were the best available. Family, child, and adolescent information from the various data sets was variable, but generally included demographic characteristics, headship, income, and maternal education and hours of employment. Some of the sets also provided information about the learning environment of the home and levels of maternal warmth, coping behaviors, depression, and social support. Information about child development outcomes differed by data set. These sets included various measures of intelligence and educational and psychosocial behaviors of children at different ages. The authors discuss deficiencies in these data and recommend ways to improve them. Results of multiple regression analysis are presented in exquisite detail in numerous tables and graphs. A summary of findings shows that neighborhood conditions often are significant predictors of aspects of child development. …",1999,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,776
10.1542/peds.2011-2663,The Lifelong Effects of Early Childhood Adversity and Toxic Stress,,"This Technical Report was retired November 2021. Advances in fields of inquiry as diverse as neuroscience, molecular biology, genomics, developmental psychology, epidemiology, sociology, and economics are catalyzing an important paradigm shift in our understanding of health and disease across the lifespan. This converging, multidisciplinary science of human development has profound implications for our ability to enhance the life prospects of children and to strengthen the social and economic fabric of society. Drawing on these multiple streams of investigation, this report presents an ecobiodevelopmental framework that illustrates how early experiences and environmental influences can leave a lasting signature on the genetic predispositions that affect emerging brain architecture and long-term health. The report also examines extensive evidence of the disruptive impacts of toxic stress, offering intriguing insights into causal mechanisms that link early adversity to later impairments in learning, behavior, and both physical and mental well-being. The implications of this framework for the practice of medicine, in general, and pediatrics, specifically, are potentially transformational. They suggest that many adult diseases should be viewed as developmental disorders that begin early in life and that persistent health disparities associated with poverty, discrimination, or maltreatment could be reduced by the alleviation of toxic stress in childhood. An ecobiodevelopmental framework also underscores the need for new thinking about the focus and boundaries of pediatric practice. It calls for pediatricians to serve as both front-line guardians of healthy child development and strategically positioned, community leaders to inform new science-based strategies that build strong foundations for educational achievement, economic productivity, responsible citizenship, and lifelong health.",2011,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,4390

George Bonanno, Ann Masten, Catherine Panter-Brick, and Rachel Yehuda tackle some of the most pressing current questions in the field of resilience research including: (1) how do we define resilience, (2) what are the most important determinants of resilience, (3) how are new technologies informing the science of resilience, and (4) what are the most effective ways to enhance resilience? These multidisciplinary experts provide insight into these difficult questions, and although each of the panelists had a slightly different definition of resilience, most of the proposed definitions included a concept of healthy, adaptive, or integrated positive functioning over the passage of time in the aftermath of adversity. The panelists agreed that resilience is a complex construct and it may be defined differently in the context of individuals, families, organizations, societies, and cultures. With regard to the determinants of resilience, there was a consensus that the empirical study of this construct needs to be approached from a multiple level of analysis perspective that includes genetic, epigenetic, developmental, demographic, cultural, economic, and social variables. The empirical study of determinates of resilience will inform efforts made at fostering resilience, with the recognition that resilience may be enhanced on numerous levels (e.g., individual, family, community, culture).",2014,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,2068

This study examined 259 public school students in third and fifth grades and found that field tests of physical fitness were positively related to academic achievement. Specifically, aerobic capacity was positively associated with achievement, whereas BMI was inversely related. Associations were demonstrated in total academic achievement, mathematics achievement, and reading achievement, thus suggesting that aspects of physical fitness may be globally related to academic performance in preadolescents.

10.1017/bec.2019.3,"Harnessing the Power of Positive Parenting to Promote Wellbeing of Children, Parents and Communities Over a Lifetime",,"Evidence-based parenting support (EBPS) programs derived from social learning theory, cognitive behavioural principles, and developmental theory are among the most successful innovations in the entire field of psychological intervention. EBPS programs have been at the cutting edge of global dissemination efforts to increase community access to evidence-based parenting programs. Despite the widely recognised success of these efforts, existing models of parenting intervention are not a panacea, and much can be done to improved outcomes. Efforts to improve outcomes have included the emergence of a population-based approach to increase reach of intervention. This has included the development of flexible delivery modalities, including online parenting interventions, the incorporation of strategies to enhance cultural relevance and acceptability of programs, and more recently, applications with parents in very low resource settings. Further enhancements of outcomes are likely to be forthcoming as we gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that explain positive intervention effects and non-response to interventions. More cost-effective online professional training models are needed to disseminate and promote the sustained use of EBPS programs. New interventions are required for the most vulnerable parents when parenting concerns are complicated by other problems such as trauma, addictions, relationship conflict, family violence, mental health problems and intergenerational poverty. However, to scale effective programs, Commonwealth and state government policies and funding priorities need to respond to evidence about what works and make sustained investments in the implementation of parenting programs. Possible strategies to enhance the policy impact of intervention research are discussed.",2019,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,16
10.2307/2657415,The Wage Penalty for Motherhood,,"Motherhood is associated with lower hourly pay, but the causes of this are not well understood. Mothers may earn less than other women because having children causes them to (1) lose job experience, (2) be less productive at work, (3) trade off higher wages for mother-friendly jobs, or (4) be discriminated against by employers. Or the relationship may be spurious rather than causal-women with lower earning potential may have children at relatively higher rates. The authors use data from the 1982-1993 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth with fixed-effects models to examine the wage penalty for motherhood. Results show a wage penalty of 7 percent per child. Penalties are larger for married women than for unmarried women. Women with (more) children have fewer years of job experience, and after controlling for experience a penalty of 5 percent per child remains. Mother-friendly characteristics of the jobs held by mothers explain little of the penalty beyond the tendency of more mothers than non-mothers to work part-time. The portion of the motherhood penalty unexplained probably results from the effect of motherhood on productivity and/or from discrimination by employers against mothers. While the benefits of mothering diffuse widely-to the employers, neighbors, friends, spouses, and children of the adults who received the mothering-the costs of child rearing are borne disproportionately by mothers.",2001,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Cognitive flexibility,1589

Advances in neuroscience suggest that a focus on self-regulation in education can enhance children's engagement in learning and establish beneficial academic trajectories in the early elementary grades. Here, we experimentally evaluate an innovative approach to the education of children in kindergarten that embeds support for self-regulation, particularly executive functions, into literacy, mathematics, and science learning activities. Results from a cluster randomized controlled trial involving 29 schools, 79 classrooms, and 759 children indicated positive effects on executive functions, reasoning ability, the control of attention, and levels of salivary cortisol and alpha amylase. Results also demonstrated improvements in reading, vocabulary, and mathematics at the end of kindergarten that increased into the first grade. A number of effects were specific to high-poverty schools, suggesting that a focus on executive functions and associated aspects of self-regulation in early elementary education holds promise for closing the achievement gap.",2014,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Executive control,356
10.1093/ije/dyh372,Cohort Profile: The Whitehall II study,,"The Whitehall studies have come to be closely associated with the investigation of socioeconomic differences in physical and mental illness and mortality: the social gradient.1,2 That was not the initial purpose of the first Whitehall study. Donald Reid and Geoffrey Rose set up Whitehall, in the 1960s, as a kind of British Framingham:3 ‘Framingham’ insofar as it was a longitudinal study of cardiorespiratory disease and diabetes, looking at individual risk factors for disease; ‘British’ in that it was done on the cheap—a simple screening examination with follow-up limited to deaths identified from the National Health Service Central Registry. Socioeconomic differences were initially not on the agenda. In the 1970s there was a small group of researchers who continued the British tradition that went back to William Farr in the nineteenth century of examining social inequalities in health.4 For the most part, within epidemiology, ‘social class’ was not an object of study but a control variable: a potential confounder that you got rid of in order to arrive at the ‘correct’ conclusion about the association between risk factor and disease. To the extent that there was a focus on inequalities in health, the general view was that poor people got diseases of material deprivation and rich people got heart disease and peptic ulcers. If this perception had been true,5,6 Whitehall showed that it was no longer so. In a population of middle-aged men, all employed in stable jobs in the British Civil Service, there was an inverse social gradient in mortality: the lower the grade, the higher the risk of death. Tenyear follow-up showed that there was a steep inverse relation between grade of employment and death from all causes, from coronary heart disease (CHD), and from non-coronary causes.7 The relative risk of death owing to CHD was 2.2 in clerical compared with senior administrative staff, and 1.6 for those in the intermediate professional and executive grade. The first Whitehall study made clear that inequalities in health were not limited to the health consequences of poverty. Important as that issue remains, the Whitehall question was why there should be a social gradient in disease in people above the poverty threshold. When conventional risk factors were controlled for, two-thirds of the mortality risk differential between the clerical and administrative grades remained unexplained.7,8 Mortality gradients in the study were in the same direction as national social class mortality data,9 but larger. We hypothesized that psychosocial factors and aspects of nutrition other than those affecting plasma cholesterol (which was higher in high grades in Whitehall) might fill in the unexplained part of the social gradient in mortality.7 We therefore set up the Whitehall II study, a new longitudinal study of British civil servants, with the explicit intention of examining reasons for the social gradient in health and disease in men and extending the research to include women.",2004,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Executive control,759

The study utilized a community sample of 306 children (36–40 months) representing the full range of family income, with 29 percent at or near poverty and 28 percent lower income. Two dimensions of effortful control (executive control and delay ability) were assessed at four time points, each separated by nine months, and growth trajectories were examined. Maternal warmth, negativity, limit setting, scaffolding, and responsiveness were observed. Above the effects of child cognitive ability, income, and cumulative risk, scaffolding predicted higher initial levels of executive control that remained higher across the study, and limit setting predicted greater gains in executive control. Parenting did not predict changes in delay ability. Significant indirect effects indicated that scaffolding mediated the effects of income and cumulative risk on growth in executive control. The findings suggest that parenting behaviors can promote effortful control in young children and could be targets of prevention programs in low‐income families.",2013,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Executive control,100

In the present research, we examined how self-affirmation can mitigate the stigma of poverty through randomized field experiments involving low-income individuals at an inner-city soup kitchen. Because of low literacy levels, we used an oral rather than written affirmation procedure, in which participants verbally described a personal experience that made them feel successful or proud. Compared with nonaffirmed participants, affirmed individuals exhibited better executive control, higher fluid intelligence, and a greater willingness to avail themselves of benefits programs. The effects were not driven by elevated positive mood, and the same intervention did not affect the performance of wealthy participants. The findings suggest that self-affirmation can improve the cognitive performance and decisions of the poor, and it may have important policy implications.",2013,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Executive control,137

Children completed a neuropsychological battery of executive control tasks and then completed two computerized executive control tasks while EEG data were collected. We predicted that differences in the event-related potential (ERP) correlates of executive attention and inhibitory control would account for income differences observed on the executive control battery. Income and ERP measures were related to performance on the executive control battery. However, income was unrelated to ERP measures.

We hypothesized that teacher stress is negatively or curvilinearly related to child EF and classroom quality may be one mechanism explaining this relation. Furthermore, as working with young, low-income children may be particularly stressful, we tested the extent to which the relation between teacher stress and child EF varies by school-level poverty. Two-level hierarchical linear models using a sample of 171 kindergarten children and 33 teachers revealed a marginally significant linear relation between teacher stress and child EF (spring) controlling for baseline child EF (fall); there was no evidence for mediation by classroom quality. School-level poverty moderated the relation between teacher stress and child EF: Children attending low-poverty schools demonstrated smaller gains in EF when their teachers reported higher stress levels.

Neither the ILO nor international trade union organizations (especially the ICFTU) has enjoyed a stable relationship with the center of hegemonic power in the labor field, since the AFL-CIO has conducted a unilateral foreign policy. The functionalist strategy of executive leadership asserting the autonomy of an international organization through task expansion in technical fields has been almost totally irrelevant to the issue. Nor has the ILO found an alternative counter-hegemonic base of support, e.g., in the Third World. The existing hegemony has reasserted itself through the ILO program and ideology even as the US has withdrawn material support. Hegemony, which no longer operates through majority votes in international organizations, works instead through bureaucratic controls. This structure of power has prevented the ILO from confronting effectively the real social issues of employment-creation, land reform, marginality, and poverty in general.

The present study provides a descriptive ‘snapshot’ of instability in low-income households, and examines the associations between exposure to major destabilizing events over the course of a year and three domains of poor urban children's self-regulation. Descriptive analyses suggest that although caregivers from unstable households report higher average levels of health problems and depression, they also have greater assets/savings, are more educated, and are less likely to be immigrants than caregivers from stable households. Results of propensity score-matched regression analyses reveal that high levels of household instability are significantly and negatively associated with preschoolers' effortful control and global attention/impulsivity control, but not with their executive function. Children from mildly unstable homes (i.e., those who had experienced a single destabilizing event in the past year) showed no significant differences in any domain of self-regulation relative to their peers from stable households, suggesting a dose-response relationship between the number of destabilizing events experienced by children and their outcomes.

Results suggest that executive function is a significant predictor of participation in drama and music clubs, sports and number of hours spent in extracurricular activities.

10.1080/03003930600896293,Local democracy and the challenges of decentralising the state: An international perspective,,"Abstract Decentralisation has been a major element of governance reform in developed, developing and transitional countries over the past two decades. The driving forces have differed, as have the outcomes. This paper reviews a number of issues concerned with decentralisation, drawing comparisons between the experience in Central and Eastern Europe with that in a range of countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The analysis focuses in six key areas: the size of local government units and the need for an intermediate tier; structures for local democratic control; citizen participation and engagement of civil society; assignment of financial resources; central – local relations; and the impact of decentralisation on service delivery, poverty reduction and corruption. The conclusion is that decentralisation needs to be carefully designed and implemented if it is to achieve the desired outcomes. Notes 1 This article draws on findings from three recent research projects conducted by the International Development Department and funded by UK Department for International Development: Urban Governance, Partnerships and Poverty: A Study of Ten Cities in Asia, Africa and Latin America; Local Government Decision-Making, Citizen Participation and Accountability in Kenya and Uganda; and Building Municipal Capacity for Finance and Budgeting: Case Studies from India, Brazil, Kenya and Uganda. 2 Based on surveys in Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Bulgaria. 3 One exception is England, where the recent attempt to introduce an elected regional tier was defeated in a referendum. One of the main reasons was that the model of regional government being proposed was perceived as taking powers away from local government rather than decentralising (or making more accountable) central government functions. 4 A third model is that of central government appointment of the executive, as found in Ghana; this raises obvious issues about local accountability and responsiveness. 5 After 1989, local governments in several of these countries also received a share of nationally collected personal income tax. 6 Up till 1999, fewer than 5 per cent of local authorities in Kenya produced or submitted annual accounts, despite numerous exhortations from the Ministry of Local Government. Once this was introduced as a performance condition for the grant, the proportion increased to nearly 100 per cent. 7 This is not restricted to developing and transitional countries: there are many examples in the UK of local level manipulation of data in order to satisfy centrally prescribed targets. 8 It is common practice, for example, in many African countries for central governments to require central approval of local budgets. The main consideration is usually whether local budgets balance, since local governments are not allowed to incur deficits. Yet a common strategy for local governments is to inflate their revenue forecasts to match the planned expenditures. As a result, the approved budget is meaningless, since the budgeted revenues do not materialise, arbitrary cuts have to be made during the year, and the local government ends up with a deficit (Devas & Grant, Citation2003). 9 A recent conference on corruption highlighted some examples of civil society initiatives in Latin America to publicise information about municipal government decision-making about resource use, as a means of combating corruption (IV Global Forum on Combating Corruption, Brasília, June 2005, http://www.ivforumglobal.cgu.gov.br).",2006,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Executive control,72

The socioeconomic literature successfully identified the major role of socioeconomic status of parents, both as a direct and indirect effect, in the shaping and intergenerational reproduction of wealth and health. Furthermore, the importance of cognitive abilities as actor in this process has been widely studied in socioeconomic literature. A third factor that has been identified by the socioeconomic discipline is the so-called non-cognitive capabilities. This category, however, lacks a clear definition and seems to be a catchall for a collection of factors. Within the repository of these non-cognitive capabilities the construct of executive functions is an interesting and important contribution from cognitive neuroscience. The multidimensional construct of executive functioning or cognitive control (i.e. planning and formulation of objectives) and monitoring processes (i.e. influences the execution of these goals) is a valuable addition to a framework on reproduction of wealth and health over generations, because executive functions are sensitive to training. Merging insights of the socioeconomic literature and cognitive neuroscience in a life cycle model opens the opportunity of educational initiatives with regard to executive functions to break the intergenerational reproduction of poverty and deprivation.",2017,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Executive control,23

While evidence linking childhood poverty and memory deficits in adulthood has been accumulating, underlying neural mechanisms are unknown. To investigate neurobiological links between childhood poverty and adult memory performance, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a visuospatial memory task in healthy young adults with varying income levels during childhood. Participants were assessed at age 9 and followed through young adulthood to assess income and related factors. During adulthood, participants completed a visuospatial memory task while undergoing MRI scanning. Patterns of neural activation, as well as memory recognition for items, were assessed to examine links between brain function and memory performance as it relates to childhood income. Our findings revealed associations between item recognition, childhood income level, and hippocampal activation. Specifically, the association between hippocampal activation and recognition accuracy varied as a function of childhood poverty, with positive associations at higher income levels, and negative associations at lower income levels. These prospective findings confirm previous retrospective results detailing deleterious effects of childhood poverty on adult memory performance. In addition, for the first time, we identify novel neurophysiological correlates of these deficits localized to hippocampus activation.",2016,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Memory,40

Verbal and visuospatial working memory tasks were administered to sixth-grade students living in low-income rural, low-income urban, high-income rural, and high-income urban developmental contexts. Both low-income rural and low-income urban children showed working memory deficits compared with their high-income counterparts, but their deficits were distinct. Low-income urban children exhibited symmetrical verbal and visuospatial working memory deficits compared with their high-income urban counterparts. Meanwhile, low-income rural children exhibited asymmetrical deficits when compared with their high-income rural counterparts, with more extreme visuospatial working memory deficits than verbal working memory deficits. These results suggest that different types of poverty are associated with different working memory abilities.",2013,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Memory,43

This article not only explores how memory can be brought into the discourse of post-disaster resilience but also critiques the very language of resilience and well-being as part of an ideological cluster with problematic implications. Resilience is a peculiarly modern form of theodicy, an explanation of misery and suffering that seeks to make sense of these fundamental, but ultimately inexplicable, human experiences. To demonstrate the limits of therapeutic discourse, the article explores Jean Amèry’s account of resentment as well as Emmanuel Levinas’ concept of “useless suffering.” Placing these concepts in the longer discourse about theodicy, the article argues for a wary contextualization of the discourse on resilience, which risks exacerbating exactly that which it seeks to aid.",2016,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Memory,13

Poverty is a type of pervasive experience that is likely to influence biobehavioral processes because children developing in such environments often encounter high levels of stress and reduced environmental stimulation. This study explores the association between socioeconomic status and the hippocampus, a brain region involved in learning and memory that is known to be affected by stress. We employ a voxel-based morphometry analytic framework with region of interest drawing for structural brain images acquired from participants across the socioeconomic spectrum (n = 317). Children from lower income backgrounds had lower hippocampal gray matter density, a measure of volume. This finding is discussed in terms of disparities in education and health that are observed across the socioeconomic spectrum.",2011,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Memory,341
10.1093/gerona/glv013,Polypharmacy Among Adults Aged 65 Years and Older in the United States: 1988–2010,,"Older adults frequently have several chronic health conditions which require multiple medications. We illustrated trends in prescription medication use over 20 years in the United States, and described characteristics of older adults using multiple medications in 2009–2010. Participants included 13,869 adults aged 65 years and older in the National Health & Nutrition Examination Survey (1988–2010). Prescription medication use was verified by medication containers. Potentially inappropriate medications were defined by the 2003 Beers Criteria. Between 1988 and 2010 the median number of prescription medications used among adults aged 65 and older doubled from 2 to 4, and the proportion taking ≥5 medications tripled from 12.8% (95% confidence interval: 11.1, 14.8) to 39.0% (35.8, 42.3).These increases were driven, in part, by rising use of cardioprotective and antidepressant medications. Use of potentially inappropriate medications decreased from 28.2% (25.5, 31.0) to 15.1% (13.2, 17.3) between 1988 and 2010. Higher medication use was associated with higher prevalence of functional limitation, activities of daily living limitation, and confusion/memory problems in 2009–2010, although these associations did not remain after adjustment for covariates. In multivariable models, older age, number of chronic conditions, and annual health care visits were associated with increased odds of using both 1–4 and ≥5 medications. Additionally, body mass index, higher income-poverty ratio, former smoking, and non-black non-white race were associated with use of ≥5 medications. Prescription medication use increased dramatically among older adults between 1988 and 2010. Contemporary older adults on multiple medications have worse health status compared with those on less medications, and appear to be a vulnerable population.",2015,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Memory,506

10.1080/13621020601099856,Inclusive Citizenship: Realizing the Potential1,,"Abstract Citizenship has been described as a ""momentum concept"". One important development over the past decade has been the various ways in which scholars and activists have developed citizenship's inclusionary potential. The first part of the article explores these developments in general terms with regard to the values underpinning inclusive citizenship; the implications of the notion of cultural citizenship; and the theorization of differentiated forms of citizenship, which nevertheless appeal to universalist principles. These principles provide the basis for the citizenship claims of people living in poverty, a group largely ignored in citizenship studies. Other lacunae have been disability and, until recently, childhood. The second part of the article discusses how citizenship studies has reworked the concept in a more inclusionary direction through the development of a multi-tiered analysis, which pays attention to the spaces and places in which lived citizenship is practised. It focuses in particular on the intimate and domestic sphere, with particular reference to debates around care and citizenship, and on the interconnections between the intimate/domestic and the global, using ""global care chains"" and ecological citizenship as examples. Notes 1 This article is dedicated to the memory of Iris Marion Young (1949–2006) whose work did so much to challenge exclusionary expressions of citizenship and to contribute to more differentiated, inclusive forms. 2 The case studies in the South (in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru and South Africa) were part of an international research partnership—the Development Research Centre on Citizenship, Participation and Accountability—based at the Institute of Development Studies in the UK (www.drc.citizenship.org). 3 Angharade E. Beckett, however, notes that not all disabled people want to be seen as different and that analysis of the UK disability movement raises the possibility that some ""individuals may be inaccurately labelled as 'different' not only by dominant 'outsiders' but also by dominant voices internal to the group"" (2005, p. 417, emphasis in original). 4 An edited collection on Children and Citizenship, edited by Clutton, Invernizzi and Williams, is also due to be published by Sage in 2007 or 2008. 5 An embodied understanding also emerges from the work of disability theorists. 6 With regard to adults, some disabled feminists have also challenged the very language of care as undermining disabled people's autonomy and hence their citizenship (see, for instance, Morris, Citation2005). 7 This issue is explored in more depth in Lister (Citation2007b).",2007,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Memory,605

Results indicated that 6 of 34 children tracked from kindergarten through second grade appeared to be SLI at the end of the study. The best kindergarten predictor for the outcome status of these 6 children was a combination of the score on the Oral Vocabulary subtest of the TOLD-2P and the score on a combination of the experimental tasks. The best single kindergarten predictor of the academic status of the 15 children in the study who received academic remediation was story-retelling. Children’s scores on the experimental and standardized tests of language performance and nonverbal intelligence were profiled over the 3 years of the study, and patterns of change in many instances reveal the lifting of the early influences of poverty.",1996,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Memory,133

The study is based on a longitudinal cohort of children in rural Ecuador (n = 2118).The schooling and vocabulary levels of mothers were strong predictors of the cognitive development of young children. Household wealth and child's height, weight, and hemoglobin levels explained only a modest fraction of the observed associations. The vocabulary levels of mothers and children were more strongly correlated among older children in the sample, suggesting that the effects of a richer maternal vocabulary are cumulative.Differences in children's cognitive outcomes start very early, which has important implications for the intergenerational transmission of poverty and inequality.

It aims, primarily, to understand why family planning became such an important point of state intervention during the Emergency, when millions were sterilized. I argue that family planning was intended as a technocratic fix for the problem of poverty and that, although the family planning program existed before the Emergency, it received a fillip through Indira Gandhi's Emergency-era push for poverty eradication thanks to the established position of population control as a prerequisite for economic development. Secondly, it aims to understand how the Emergency and sterilization have become conflated in popular memory, such that the driving forces of poverty eradication and economic development have dropped out of the story altogether. The link between poverty eradication and population control has been forgotten, and a narrative of arbitrary family planning “excess” endured.",2014,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Memory,66
10.3389/fpubh.2024.1341501,"Association between poverty, low educational level and smoking with adolescent’s working memory: cross lagged analysis from longitudinal data",,"Background Working memory is a crucial element of cognitive function. Previous cross-sectional studies have identified various determinants of working memory in children and adolescents. Nonetheless, no study has yet demonstrated the causal relationship of social determinants with working memory in adolescents. Objective This study explores the causal link between the level of education, smoking, and other factors with adolescent’s working memory. Methods This study analyzed secondary data from waves 4 and 5 of the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), utilizing cross-lagged analysis in Jamovi version 2.4.8. The variables included working memory score, maternal education, household income, stress, educational level, smoking, urbanicity, and physical activity. These variables were extracted from IFLS waves 4 and 5, and each dependent variable in IFLS wave four was controlled by the same dependent variables in IFLS 5. Then, we used cross-lagged analysis to assess the causality between each dependent variable and a working memory score in IFLS wave 5. Result The findings indicate that level of education had a positive impact on working memory in adolescents aged 15–18 years, with a Beta value of 0.18 (95% CI 0.81–0.2; p &amp;lt; 0.001). Smoking and age were negatively associated with working memory, with Beta values of −0.07 (95% CI -0.65 -0.04; p &amp;lt; 0.029) and − 0.10 (95% CI -0.25 -0.05; p &amp;lt; 0.003), respectively. No evidence was found for a significant correlation between poverty and adolescents’s working memory. Conclusion The findings indicate that increased education levels are associated with improved working memory in adolescents aged 15–18.

10.1111/desc.12822,Early adversity in rural India impacts the brain networks underlying visual working memory,,"Abstract There is a growing need to understand the global impact of poverty on early brain and behavioural development, particularly with regard to key cognitive processes that emerge in early development. Although the impact of adversity on brain development can trap children in an intergenerational cycle of poverty, the massive potential for brain plasticity is also a source of hope: reliable, accessible, culturally agnostic methods to assess early brain development in low resource settings might be used to measure the impact of early adversity, identify infants for timely intervention and guide the development and monitor the effectiveness of early interventions. Visual working memory (VWM) is an early marker of cognitive capacity that has been assessed reliably in early infancy and is predictive of later academic achievement in Western countries. Here, we localized the functional brain networks that underlie VWM in early development in rural India using a portable neuroimaging system, and we assessed the impact of adversity on these brain networks. We recorded functional brain activity as young children aged 4–48 months performed a VWM task. Brain imaging results revealed localized activation in the frontal cortex, replicating findings from a Midwestern US sample. Critically, children from families with low maternal education and income showed weaker brain activity and poorer distractor suppression in canonical working memory areas in the left frontal cortex. Implications of this work are far‐reaching: it is now cost‐effective to localize functional brain networks in early development in low‐resource settings, paving the way for novel intervention and assessment methods.",2019,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and working memory,69

Measures of environmental unpredictability, violence, and poverty were collected to test adversity × task version interactions. There were no interactions for attention shifting.

An emerging hypothesis suggests that cognitive and affective stress associated with poverty may tax neurocognitive functions, such as working memory (WM), and lead to impulsive DRD. Furthermore, research suggests that emotional reactivity (ER) is an important dispositional factor to consider in the link between executive functions and DRD. Thus, we longitudinally examined the indirect effect of SH on impulsive DRD via a network of brain regions associated with WM function in a sample of young adults, and whether that link was moderated by ER. Participants were 119 rural African Americans (aged 19-24 years) assessed behaviorally on four occasions, with fMRI at the last time point. Results showed that, among emerging adults with higher ER, SH severity was predictive of increased DRD via reduced response in brain regions activated during an n-back WM task. These findings reveal both the cognitive and affective mechanisms that underlie the relationship between SH and DRD.",2019,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and working memory,68

In an effort to understand the impact that the physical learning environment, such as noise or large class sizes, have on learning in South African foundation phase classrooms, this study deployed a qualitative case study design to gain insight into the learning and teaching that take place in Grade 1 classrooms. From a cognitive load perspective, the study found that noise, as result of the large number of learners in the class, as well as noise from the outdoor environment, contributes to the overload of learners’ working memory, which ultimately impacts negatively on learning. The study also found that the large classroom sizes in Grade 1 prevented teachers from rendering effective support, which causes uncertainty among learners in regard to what is expected of them when working on classroom tasks. This uncertainty leads to extraneous cognitive load.Keywords: education; extraneous cognitive load; foundation phase; mathematics; physical learning environment; poverty eradication; South Africa; sustainable development; working memory",2019,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and working memory,26

Eleven tests measured cognitive function. Interactions among diabetes, race, and poverty status with cognition were assessed in multiple regression analyses.Significant interactions among diabetes, race, and poverty status were observed. Among African Americans below poverty, diabetic individuals performed lower than nondiabetic individuals on California Verbal Learning Test Free Recall Short Delay (z = -0.444 [0.123] versus z = -0.137 [0.045]) and Long Delay (z = -0.299 [0.123] versus z = -0.130 [0.045]), Digit Span Backward (z = -0.347 [0.109] versus z = -0.072 [0.041]), and the Brief Test of Attention (z = -0.452 [-0.099] versus z = -0.099 [0.047]), and higher on Category Fluency (z = 0.114 [0.117] versus z = -0.118 [0.044]). No consistent differences between diabetic and nondiabetic individuals were found for African American and white participants above poverty.Diabetes was associated with poorer verbal memory, working memory, and attention among African Americans living in poverty. Diabetic African Americans below poverty may have increased risk of cognitive deficit at a younger age. Improving health literacy, doctor-patient communication, and multidisciplinary medical care for impoverished individuals may reduce differences.

The effects of sleep on cognition are not uniform and thus we tested race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and sex as moderators of these associations. At the first assessment, 282 children aged 9.44 years (52% boys, 65% European American [EA], 35% African American [AA]) participated. Two more waves of data collection spaced 1 year apart followed. The majority of children (63%) were living at or below the poverty line. Children's sleep was measured objectively with actigraphy and 2 well-established sleep parameters were derived: duration, indexed by sleep minutes between sleep onset and wake time, and quality, indexed by efficiency. Multiple cognitive functioning domains were examined with the Woodcock Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities (WJ III). Across the sample, higher sleep efficiency, but not duration, was associated with better cognitive performance. Significant moderation effects emerged. Controlling for SES, AA children scored lower on general intellectual ability and working memory (WM) at age 11 only if they experienced lower sleep efficiency at age 9. Further, boys scored lower on general abilities and processing speed (PS) at age 11 only if their sleep efficiency was lower at age 9. Findings indicate that lower sleep efficiency may contribute to lower cognitive functioning especially for AA children and boys. These vulnerabilities appear to emerge early in development and are maintained over time. Results underscore the importance of individual differences in explicating relations between sleep and children's cognitive performance.

However, in the Asian setting, with its prevailing poverty, information about the influence of SES on cognitive development of female adolescents is limited. This study was aimed to investigate the association between SES and neurocognitive performance of early female adolescents in Sri Lanka. Methods Female adolescents aged 11–14 years (n = 200) of low and middle SES were studied to assess neurocognitive function. After obtaining baseline data, eight subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC – IV), Test Of Nonverbal Intelligence (TONI-3) and two computer-based executive function tests (inhibition and visuo-spatial working memory) were administered to assess neurocognitive measures of the above adolescents. The results were compiled into a data base and analyzed using SPSS version 20 statistical software. Results Higher SES was associated with higher performance in all neurocognitive tests. Low SES adolescents obtained significantly poor test scores for executive function test (inhibitory control: p &lt; 0.0001) and for WISC [verbal comprehension index (VCI): p &lt; 0.0001), working memory index (WMI): p &lt; 0.0001 and estimated full scale IQ (EFSIQ): p &lt; 0.0001)] when compared with middle SES adolescents. Maternal education alone significantly predicts VCI and EFSIQ than the combined influence of parental education, occupation and income.

Using data from the 2001-2004 National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent Supplement, a cross-sectional US population study of adolescents aged 13-18 years (n = 10,073), we examined the associations between 11 childhood adversities and intelligence, using targeted maximum likelihood estimation. Targeted maximum likelihood estimation incorporates machine learning to identify the relationships between exposures and outcomes without overfitting, including interactions and nonlinearity. The nonverbal score from the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test was used as a standardized measure of fluid reasoning. Childhood adversities were grouped into deprivation and threat types based on recent conceptual models. Adjusted marginal mean differences compared the mean intelligence score if all adolescents experienced each adversity to the mean in the absence of the adversity. The largest associations were observed for deprivation-type experiences, including poverty and low parental education, which were related to reduced intelligence. Although lower in magnitude, threat events related to intelligence included physical abuse and witnessing domestic violence. Violence prevention and poverty-reduction measures would likely improve childhood cognitive outcomes.",2018,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Fluid intelligence,26

10.2307/1602514,Long-Term Developmental Outcomes of Low Birth Weight Infants,,"Advances in neonatal medicine have resulted in the increased survival of infants at lower and lower birth weight. While these medical success stories highlight the power of medical technology to save many of the tiniest infants at birth, serious questions remain about how these infants will develop and whether they will have normal, productive lives. Low birth weight children can be born at term or before term and have varying degrees of social and medical risk. Because low birth weight children are not a homogeneous group, they have a broad spectrum of growth, health, and developmental outcomes. While the vast majority of low birth weight children have normal outcomes, as a group they generally have higher rates of subnormal growth, illnesses, and neurodevelopmental problems. These problems increase as the child's birth weight decreases. With the exception of a small minority of low birth weight children with mental retardation and/or cerebral palsy, the developmental sequelae for most low birth weight infants include mild problems in cognition, attention, and neuromotor functioning. Long-term follow-up studies conducted on children born in the 1960s indicated that the adverse consequences of being born low birth weight were still apparent in adolescence. Adverse sociodemographic factors negatively affect developmental outcomes across the continuum of low birth weight and appear to have far greater effects on long-term cognitive outcomes than most of the biological risk factors. In addition, the cognitive defects associated with social or environmental risks become more pronounced as the child ages. Enrichment programs for low birth weight children seem to be most effective for the moderately low birth weight child who comes from a lower socioeconomic group. Continued research and attempts to decrease the rate of low birth weight and associated perinatal medical sequelae are of primary importance. Ongoing documentation of the long-term outcome of low birth weight children needs to be mandated, as does the implementation of environmental enrichment programs to help ameliorate the long-term consequences for infants who are born low birth weight.",1995,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Fluid intelligence,708

However, the association between neighborhood deprivation, an index of community-level socioeconomic status, and child cognition is not fully understood. The goal of this study was to investigate (1) the relationship between neighborhood deprivation and child cognitive functioning and (2) whether child age moderates the relationship between cognitive functioning and neighborhood deprivation. Methods: This study included 9878 children, ages 3 through 17 years (M = 10.4 yrs, SD = 3.4 yrs). Data were gathered from children referred for and evaluated at an urban, outpatient neuropsychology assessment clinic between 2006 and 2022, located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Neighborhood socioeconomic status was measured at the census block level using the Area Deprivation Index composite. Results: There was a 20-point median difference in overall intelligence between the neighborhoods with the lowest and highest levels of deprivation. Overall intelligence and verbal comprehension, compared with working memory, fluid reasoning, and processing speed, demonstrated the strongest negative association with neighborhood deprivation (all p &lt; 0.05). Older children had lower overall intelligence scores compared with younger children in neighborhoods with high levels of deprivation ( p &lt; 0.01), suggesting a cumulative influence of poverty exposure. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the stark disparities in child cognitive functioning across levels of neighborhood deprivation. Findings support the importance of access to early interventions and services that promote intellectual growth and verbal capacity among children who live in neighborhoods with great deprivation.",2023,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Fluid intelligence,5

It is a condition that can have adverse health, social and educational outcomes. It also exacts significant societal costs, economically and socially. This paper hypothesises that the population of children receiving a clinical diagnosis of ADHD is aetiologically heterogeneous: that within this population, there is a group for whom the development of ADHD is largely genetically driven, and another who have a ‘phenocopy’ of ADHD as a result of very adverse early childhood experiences, with the prevalence of this phenocopy being heavily skewed towards populations living with poverty and violence. A third group will have a high genetic risk and have been exposed to violence. These groups will overlap, with epigenetic phenomena and other environmental factors, for example, preterm birth, poor intrauterine growth, foetal exposure to teratogens, playing an important role for all affected children in determining the severity of their functional difficulties.

### Phenocopies

Phenocopies occur when people exhibit a phenotype that appears identical to that found in other individuals who have a linked genotype, but do not possess this genotype themselves. Environmental factors may cause this, as occurs in Rutter's autism phenocopy described in Romanian orphans adopted by western families in the early 1990s.1 These children had experienced extreme, profound neglect; after adoption, they began to present to services with abnormal or delayed development. Many presented a clinical and behavioural picture indistinguishable from autism in preschool children. However, follow-up revealed a different natural history to that of childhood autism, with these children no longer fulfilling criteria for autism, with mild cognitive impairment, low empathy and conduct problems prevailing in adolescence.2 Animal models suggest a possible epigenetic mechanism for this, with environments of profound neglect associated with alterations in gene expression as a result of …",2013,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Attention,35
10.1353/jod.1995.0002,Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital,,"Bowling Alone: America’s Declining Social Capital Robert D. Putnam (bio) Many students of the new democracies that have emerged over the past decade and a half have emphasized the importance of a strong and active civil society to the consolidation of democracy. Especially with regard to the postcommunist countries, scholars and democratic activists alike have lamented the absence or obliteration of traditions of independent civic engagement and a widespread tendency toward passive reliance on the state. To those concerned with the weakness of civil societies in the developing or postcommunist world, the advanced Western democracies and above all the United States have typically been taken as models to be emulated. There is striking evidence, however, that the vibrancy of American civil society has notably declined over the past several decades. Ever since the publication of Alexis de Tocqueville’s Democracy in America, the United States has played a central role in systematic studies of the links between democracy and civil society. Although this is in part because trends in American life are often regarded as harbingers of social modernization, it is also because America has traditionally been considered unusually “civic” (a reputation that, as we shall later see, has not been entirely unjustified). When Tocqueville visited the United States in the 1830s, it was the Americans’ propensity for civic association that most impressed him as the key to their unprecedented ability to make democracy work. “Americans of all ages, all stations in life, and all types of disposition,” [End Page 65] he observed, “are forever forming associations. There are not only commercial and industrial associations in which all take part, but others of a thousand different types—religious, moral, serious, futile, very general and very limited, immensely large and very minute. . . . Nothing, in my view, deserves more attention than the intellectual and moral associations in America.” 1 Recently, American social scientists of a neo-Tocquevillean bent have unearthed a wide range of empirical evidence that the quality of public life and the performance of social institutions (and not only in America) are indeed powerfully influenced by norms and networks of civic engagement. Researchers in such fields as education, urban poverty, unemployment, the control of crime and drug abuse, and even health have discovered that successful outcomes are more likely in civically engaged communities. Similarly, research on the varying economic attainments of different ethnic groups in the United States has demonstrated the importance of social bonds within each group. These results are consistent with research in a wide range of settings that demonstrates the vital importance of social networks for job placement and many other economic outcomes. Meanwhile, a seemingly unrelated body of research on the sociology of economic development has also focused attention on the role of social networks. Some of this work is situated in the developing countries, and some of it elucidates the peculiarly successful “network capitalism” of East Asia. 2 Even in less exotic Western economies, however, researchers have discovered highly efficient, highly flexible “industrial districts” based on networks of collaboration among workers and small entrepreneurs. Far from being paleoindustrial anachronisms, these dense interpersonal and interorganizational networks undergird ultramodern industries, from the high tech of Silicon Valley to the high fashion of Benetton. The norms and networks of civic engagement also powerfully affect the performance of representative government. That, at least, was the central conclusion of my own 20-year, quasi-experimental study of subnational governments in different regions of Italy. 3 Although all these regional governments seemed identical on paper, their levels of effectiveness varied dramatically. Systematic inquiry showed that the quality of governance was determined by longstanding traditions of civic engagement (or its absence). Voter turnout, newspaper readership, membership in choral societies and football clubs—these were the hallmarks of a successful region. In fact, historical analysis suggested that these networks of organized reciprocity and civic solidarity, far from being an epiphenomenon of socioeconomic modernization, were a precondition for it. No doubt the mechanisms through which civic engagement and social connectedness produce such results—better schools, faster economic [End Page 66] development, lower crime, and more effective government—are multiple and complex. While these briefly recounted findings require further confirmation and perhaps qualification, the...",1995,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Attention,13489

Chronic poverty focuses attention on that subset of poor persons whose capability deprivations endure across time. But how should the dimensions of chronic poverty be selected? This question is complex because the relevant dimensions must in some sense be chosen at the start of a study, and yet preferences or values may change. Nussbaum argues that there should be a 'list' of core capabilities; Sen argues that the capabilities should be selected in light of the purpose of the study and the values of the referent populations, and that their selection should be explicit and open to public debate and scrutiny. In the literature, if authors give any justification at all of their selection (many do not), they justify it on the basis of up to five criteria. This paper argues that the dimensions of chronic poverty for research studies should be selected using a 'mixed' method approach that combines the selection of a static set of core dimensions (using explicit criteria which are described) with participatory studies that report the relative importance of each dimensions to the respondents during different waves of the survey.",2007,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Attention,257

If more attention is given to sorting out these questions, “good enough governance” may become a more realistic goal for many countries faced with the goal of reducing poverty.

Children who were lead‐exposed demonstrated less self‐regulated attention than comparisons and had poorer puzzle performance in the child‐alone condition. Attention patterns did not differ in the parent–child condition. This study extends previous knowledge concerning effects of lead exposure on preschool children from disadvantaged environments and suggests that lead exposure affects specific attention regulation abilities.",2004,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Attention,21

This scientific concept is used extensively not only in the analysis of social conditions but also, in an applied form, as an instrument of policy in allocating resources to particular regions, areas and services. This paper argues that the indicators which are chosen to represent the phenomenon are often unduly restricted and even involve double counting. As a result the distribution and severity of deprivation seems to be seriously misperceived and resources misallocated. A review of the available studies shows how the concept might be treated more coherently in relation to that of poverty.",1987,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Attention,1070

This paper draws on research on the Zambian Copperbelt to show how impact on income distribution depends upon who obtains loans, who graduates to larger loans, who exits and group dynamics. Some initial levelling up of business income was found, but the more marked overall effect among borrowers was of income polarisation. To gain a full picture, more research is needed into the wider impact of the big gainers not only on their competitors, customers and employees, but also on political tolerance of inequality.

However, recent years have witnessed an increasing preoccupation with the phenomenon of time poverty, drawing attention to the distribution of free time and its relationship to structural and family circumstances. In this article we propose a novel approach to the measurement of time poverty and document its occurrence amongst British workers. In line with previous literature, a conceptualization of time poverty as a relative lack of free time resources vis‐à‐vis other members of the community is adopted. However, unlike previous empirical studies, we investigate the differential configuration of time poverty on weekdays and weekend days, alongside indicators of the quality of free time, taking into account insights from theoretical and empirical work within the field of the sociology of time. Our analysis of the 2000 UK Time Use Survey highlights class and gender inequalities that have been missed by previous measurement approaches and demonstrates that, overall, working women experience multiple and more severe free time constraints, which may constitute an additional barrier for their leisure and social participation.",2012,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Attention,139

This work links the extent to which households smooth consumption or smooth assets given income shocks, the empirical evidence on the churning of households in and out of poverty, and the possibility that temporary shocks can have permanent consequences. Using longitudinal data from rural Zimbabwe, this paper extends the discussion of these issues by disaggregating the impact of shocks by levels of asset holdings, by disaggregating the impact of shocks on individual level welfare and by assessing the extent to which such shocks have permanent consequences. By doing so, it assesses the validity of distinguishing between asset and consumption smoothing and provides insights into whether poverty dynamics assessed at the household level provide an adequate picture of dynamics at the individual level.",2006,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Attention,427

OBJECTIVE To investigate whether the income-to-needs ratio experienced in early childhood impacts brain development at school age and to explore the mediators of this effect. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study was conducted at an academic research unit at the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis. Data from a prospective longitudinal study of emotion development in preschool children who participated in neuroimaging at school age were used to investigate the effects of poverty on brain development. Children were assessed annually for 3 to 6 years prior to the time of a magnetic resonance imaging scan, during which they were evaluated on psychosocial, behavioral, and other developmental dimensions. Preschoolers included in the study were 3 to 6 years of age and were recruited from primary care and day care sites in the St Louis metropolitan area; they were annually assessed behaviorally for 5 to 10 years. Healthy preschoolers and those with clinical symptoms of depression participated in neuroimaging at school age/early adolescence. EXPOSURE Household poverty as measured by the income-to-needs ratio. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Brain volumes of children's white matter and cortical gray matter, as well as hippocampus and amygdala volumes, obtained using magnetic resonance imaging. Mediators of interest were caregiver support/hostility measured observationally during the preschool period and stressful life events measured prospectively. RESULTS Poverty was associated with smaller white and cortical gray matter and hippocampal and amygdala volumes. The effects of poverty on hippocampal volume were mediated by caregiving support/hostility on the left and right, as well as stressful life events on the left. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The finding that exposure to poverty in early childhood materially impacts brain development at school age further underscores the importance of attention to the well-established deleterious effects of poverty on child development. Findings that these effects on the hippocampus are mediated by caregiving and stressful life events suggest that attempts to enhance early caregiving should be a focused public health target for prevention and early intervention. Findings substantiate the behavioral literature on the negative effects of poverty on child development and provide new data confirming that effects extend to brain development. Mechanisms for these effects on the hippocampus are suggested to inform intervention.",2013,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Attention,692

The United Nations Development Programme's gender indices go some way to reflecting gendered poverty, but there is scope for improvement. In order to work towards aggregate indices that are more sensitive to gender gaps in poverty as identified and experienced by poor women, the main aims of this paper are two‐fold. The first is to draw attention to existing conceptual and methodological weaknesses with the “feminization of poverty”, and to suggest how the construct could better depict contemporary trends in gendered privation. The second is to propose directions for the kinds of data and indicators that might be incorporated within the Gender‐related Development Index or the Gender Empowerment Measure, or used in the creation of a Gendered Poverty Index.",2006,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Attention,340
10.1017/s004727940300713x,Overlaps in Dimensions of Poverty,,"The Poverty and Social Exclusion Survey of Britain made it possible first time to explore poverty using three different measures applied at the same time on the same sample. The measures were: lacking socially perceived necessities; being subjectively poor and having a relatively low income. These approaches are all commonly used to identify the poor and to measure poverty but rarely if ever in combination. In this article we have found that there is little overlap in the group of people defined as poor by these dimensions. There are reasons for this lack of overlap, connected to the reliability and validity of the different measures. However the people who are defined as living in poverty by different measures of poverty are different. This inevitably means that the policy response to poverty will be different depending on which measure is employed. We have attempted to analyse overlap in two ways. First, by exploring the dimensions of poverty cumulatively, we have found that, the more dimensions people are poor on, the more they are unlike the non-poor and the poor on only one dimension, in their characteristics and in their social exclusion. Second, by treating particular dimensions as meriting more attention than others, we explored three permutations of this type and concluded that, while each permutation were more unlike the non-poor than those poor on a single dimension, they were not as unlike the non-poor as the cumulatively poor were. These results indicate that accumulation might be a better way of using overlapping measures of poverty than by giving priority to one dimension over another. The implication of the paper is that it is not safe to rely on one measure of poverty – the results obtained are just not reliable enough. Surveys, such as the Family Resources Survey or the European Community Household Panel, which are used to monitor the prevalence of poverty, need to be adapted to enable results to be triangulated – to incorporate a wider range of poverty measures.",2003,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Attention,365

Policy, research, and practice will be improved if greater attention is given to social context. The authors critically analyze the approach used in much of the psychiatric services literature to infer links between mental illness and social problems. They compare these studies with studies that have been more validly conceptualized to account for social context. With this broader perspective, the impact of mental illness on crime, unemployment, and homelessness appears to be much smaller than that implied by much of the psychiatric services literature. Poverty moderates the relationship between serious mental illness and social problems. Factors related to poverty include lack of education, problems with employment, substance abuse, and a low likelihood of prosocial attachments. This relationship is often complicated and is not amenable to simple explanations.

10.1300/j013v12n03_02,Women and Poverty:,,"In the current debate about causes and cures for poverty, much attention is given to women. Women are more likely than men to be poor, and once impoverished, to remain poor for longer periods of time than do men. In addition, a much greater responsibility for raising the next generation of adults belongs to poor women than to poor men. No individual policy response will alleviate poverty among women. Rather, a multi-faceted policy response that recognizes the wide diversity of their situations is necessary. This paper describes the diversity among poor women and suggests a series of appropriate policies.In the current debate about the causes of and cures for poverty, much attention has been focused on women. Women are generally more likely than men to be poor and to remain poor for longer periods of time. By ignoring the diversity of the poor female population, policy makers fail to develop policies that address the needs of poor women in all categories. Instead, stereotypical descriptions of poor women and quick-fix solutions abound. Wilson examines the diverse characteristics of poor women and offers suggestions for more helpful policies. Wilson describes poor women in a series of statements, a sample of which follow. 1) Women who head their own households are nearly 5 times as likely to be poor as men who head their own households. 2) Over the past 2 1/2 decades, the share of poor people living in female-headed households has risen from 18% to 35%. 3) There are as many poor married women as poor women who head households. 4) Over the past 15 years, the average size of poor female-headed households has declined somewhat. 5) Only 1 in 5 poor women with children heading their own households receives any financial support from their children's fathers. 6) Nearly 6 in 10 poor women heading households received public assistance in 1984. Multiple strategies to combat poverty among poor women must be instituted. The most important antipoverty strategy is creation of a productive, high-employment economy. Most poor women work, but have low wages and too few work hours. Other helpful policies include raising the minimum wage, providing health coverage to uninsured or inadequately insured working poor families, and increasing financial support for child care. Improving the educational system, discouraging high school drop-outs, and discouraging early pregnancy would also help, as would enforcing child support payments and extending public assistance to 2-parent families in poverty. Increasing benefit levels to all eligible households would further diminish poverty. None of these strategies is effective alone; only a multifaceted antipoverty strategy will be effective.",1988,Openalex,Cognitive function,Poverty and Attention,120

Residents living in buildings without nearby trees and grass reported more procrastination in facing their major issues and assessed their issues as more severe, less soluble, and more longstanding than did their counterparts living in greener surroundings.

Subjective rates of time preference, identified from estimation of consumption Euler equations, are three to five percentage points higher for households with low permanent incomes than for those with high permanent incomes. Controlling for race and education widens this difference. With age and family composition held constant, time preference rates vary from 12 percent for white, college-educated families in the top 5 percent of the labor income distribution to 19 percent for nonwhite families without a college education whose labor incomes are in the bottom fifth percentile.

In general, the rates were found to be very high. Factors influencing or correlated with the personal rates of time preference were investigated through regression methods. OLS was the technique used in the estimation. Market imperfections, particularly in credit and insurance markets lead to variation in RTPs. Poverty in assets, or cash liquidity constraints, was leading to or correlated with higher rates of time preference. The poor are, therefore, less likely to invest in environmental conservation. In Zambia, independent estimates of risk preferences were made. More risk-averse people tended to have lower RTPs. The results support the hypothesis that poverty and/or liquidity scarcity lead to high RTPs. Poverty reduction may thus reduce the RTPs of the poor and reduce the 'intertemporal externality' due to high RTPs. The high average RTPs indicate, however, that complementary policies may be needed to ensure sufficient levels of investment in conservation. Another logical implication is that institutionalization of private property rights may not be a sufficient tool to initiate sustainable resource management.",1998,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Time preference,299

We solve the dynamic optimization problem facing an agent and provide a complete characterization of the steady states and their stability properties. We find that with endogenous rate of time preference an economy may have multiple steady state equilibria. The equilibrium an economy converges to depends on its initial conditions. The results are interpreted in light of the growth experiences of developing economies. The model can explain why two economies that have identical production technologies and identical preferences may converge to different levels of income depending on initial conditions.

Social policies likely affect terrorism in offsetting ways but, on balance, should diminish preferences for terrorism by reducing economic insecurity, inequality, poverty, and religious-political extremism. Thus, countries with more generous welfare provisions should suffer fewer terrorist attacks on their soil and have fewer of their citizens perpetrate terrorism. Supporting this argument, cross-sectional estimation reveals that a country's welfare efforts negatively correlate with transnational or total terrorist incidents on its soil, as well as transnational terrorism perpetrated by its citizens. Pooled cross-section time-series estimation reveals that several measures of welfare effort reduce the incidence of transnational terrorism in countries, robust to a range of estimators and controls.

Following maize market deregulation and subsequent entry of private buyers in the Zimbabwean grain sector, marginalised poor farmers remained confined to the low return private buyer market that offered very low prices, as they avoided GMB whose payment plan was uncertain and delayed. The question therefore was: To what extent did farmers' risk aversion attitude and time preference explain the poor farmers' choice for low return private buyer market at the expense of the high return GMB market? Using survey data obtained from 433 maize farmers in Makonde and Zvimba districts, an instrumental variable probit regression model was estimated. The results confirmed that risk aversion attitude and time preferences (as measured by farmers' discount rate) reduced the likelihood of a farmer participating in a high return state-owned GMB market. Poor farmers were found to be more risk averse and impatient than non-poor farmers in marketing channel selection. Their high risk aversion attitude and impatience constituted the greatest market impediments that restricted them to the low return private buyer market. To make agricultural markets work for poverty reduction the study recommended that policies that promote the development of risk transfer markets and futures markets for maturity transformation of farmers' payments are critical in guaranteeing effective participation of poor households in high return markets.",2018,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Time preference,4

Time poverty is thus understood as the lack of enough time for rest and leisure after accounting for the time that has to be spent working, whether in the labor market, doing domestic work, or performing other activities such as fetching water and wood. The study applies the concepts used in the traditional poverty literature to measure time poverty defined in this new way to analyze its determinants in Guinea from 2002 to 2003. It finds that women are more likely to be time poor than men in Guinea, and even more so according to this new definition.

Notes 1 They calculate that women worked roughly 15 hours longer each week than men and that, over a year, they worked an extra month of 24-hour days. 2 According to the 1995 Human Development Report (United Nations Development Programme 1995 United Nations Development Programme. 1995. Human Development Report 1995, New York: Oxford University Press. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]), using data from a sample of thirty-one countries, women's share in total work was 53 percent in developing countries and 51 percent in industrial countries. Moreover, the distribution of women's time was two-thirds in unpaid work and only one-third in paid work; for men, these percentages are reversed. In developing countries, men were found to spend even less time in unpaid work. 3 We use ""freedom of choice"" in a simplistic way to mean a broader set of options. Obviously, the definition of what this means in practice is not straightforward. One possibility is to use a concept of minimum necessary time (an absolute time-poverty line) and calculate all possible combinations of time and income that the individual can generate by working different numbers of hours and purchasing different amounts of replacement services, while still meeting minimum obligations (see Burchardt 2008 Burchardt, Tania. Time and Income Poverty. CASE Report 57. London: Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion (CASE), London School of Economics. [Google Scholar]). Other alternative definitions of ""freedom of choice"" are possible; for example, one could calculate the share of time spent providing for basic needs over the total time spent as an indicator that helps distinguish people who work long hours by necessity versus ""free choice"" (we thank one of the referees for this suggestion). It should be noted, however, that the actual time spent in meeting basic needs when used as an indicator of the constraints faced by household members in the use of their time is itself dependent on the poverty status of the household. That is, the fact that very poor people spend a great deal of time on the fulfillment of basic needs is in part due to their poverty, which prevents them from living in areas with access to piped-in water, so that they need to spend significant time fetching water; this in turn results in less time for paid work (as noted by a referee, poor people's time allocations are devoted first to activities that fulfill their basic needs, which is an outcome of their revealed preference functions, as noted by Nicky R. M. Pouw 2008 Pouw, Nicky R.M. 2008. The Characterization and Monitoring of Poverty: Smallholder Farmers in Rural Uganda, Amsterdam: Rozenberg. [Google Scholar]). Another issue is that some among the poor have very few options in the paid labor market and may end up spending more time in basic needs activities simply because they are underemployed. 4 Makdissi and Wodon (2004 Makdissi, Paul and Wodon, Quentin. 2004. ""Robust Comparisons of Natural Resources Depletion Indices."". Economics Bulletin, 9(2): 1–9. [Google Scholar]) show that the approach to robust comparisons for poverty measurement using stochastic dominance may be adapted to indicators where excess (for example, polluting more than a benchmark of what is acceptable), as opposed to insufficiency (for example, consuming less than what is needed for basic needs), is considered as welfare-reducing. 5 This is a nationally representative and somewhat standard priority survey with detailed modules on household composition, income, consumption, education, and health, among others. The survey also includes a time-use module. The survey includes data on 7,611 households; but 516 households were deleted from the analysis for various reasons, leading to poor data for these households. 6 We preferred this variable to the alternative ""female-headed household"" because many female-headed households in Guinea include several adult men. 7 While it is obvious that availability of or proximity to water and electricity can save women several hours a week, there are virtually no studies that show how the saved time would be spent, and in particular whether this time would be spent in (decently) paid work. In other words, while infrastructural policies are clearly necessary, it is less apparent whether lack of infrastructure is the binding constraint to poverty or if other policies would be required.",2010,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Time preference,131

A series of cross-sectional analyses of geographical and social determinants of poverty rates and median household income are used to analyse whether the determinants are changing over time. Large, older central cities in the north-east and mid-west have experienced increasing poverty and decreases in income relative to their own history and relative to their own suburbs. There is some evidence of economic decline in the inner suburbs of these central cities relative to other suburbs, but not relative to the central cities. The geographical shifts in MSA population among suburbs by income between 1970 and 1990 are analysed relative to initial social characteristics of civil divisions. The study concludes that the filtering of older residential buildings to, and the lower marginal preference for land of, lower-income groups contributes to the rising poverty rates and decreases in median household income for all central cities and for the inner suburbs of the north-eastern and mid-western MSAs. The study finds little evidence that either 'white flight' or the non-poor's avoidance of taxes to support the poor are important factors in the shifts of population among suburbs.",2003,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Time preference,90

Furthermore, there is rarely enough private investment taking place to commensurate the scale of the problem. This article examines the role of tenure insecurity, resource poverty, risk and time preferences, and community‐led land conservation on differentiated patterns of household investment in land conservation in northern Ethiopia. We control for biophysical, household characteristics, market access conditions, and village level factors. Investments in soil bunds and stone terraces are specifically studied so as to capture the link between these various factors and the durability of conservation investments. We introduce the distinction between the determinants of the decision to invest and how much to invest in conservation. Regression results show that publicly led conservation programs seem to significantly stimulate private investment. A host of plot‐level variables and household perceptions of returns on conservation investments, expressed in terms of perceived improvements in land quality and increased crop yields, were found to be critical to the decision to invest and intensify soil conservation. The evidence on the significance of households' attitudes toward risk aversion suggests the important role of risk and the household's risk‐bearing capacity in the decision to intensify conservation measures. At the same time, tenure security indicators and households' resource endowments (resource poverty) had weaker effects in increasing willingness to invest and the level of investment made. The policy implications of these results point to the importance of agricultural research and extension efforts that target technologies which reduce household risk and poverty while enabling sustainable investments in conservation measures by individual households.",2006,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Time preference,70
10.1111/j.1467-9833.2009.01445.x,"Climate Change and the Future: Discounting for Time, Wealth, and Risk",,"There is no quality in human nature, which causes more fatal errors in our conduct, than that which leads us to prefer whatever is present to the distant and remote, and makes us desire objects more according to their situation than their intrinsic value.1 It is widely recognized that the Earth's climate is undergoing profound changes. The most authoritative analysis is that produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In its most recent report, the Fourth Assessment Report, the IPCC confirmed that the Earth's climate is getting warmer and is projected to continue to do so. The report employs six different scenarios. According to these six scenarios, the likely increase in temperature ranges from 1.1°C to 6.4°C and the likely increase in sea level ranges from 0.18 meters to 0.59 meters.2 Climate change will have very severe impacts on many people—producing poverty, disease, instability, and death from freak weather events. It will, in particular, have dire consequences for members of developing countries. I have argued elsewhere that it jeopardizes fundamental human rights.3 In light of this, there is a strong case for engaging in a vigorous policy of mitigation. Some, however, query this, arguing that many of the impacts of climate change will be felt in the future and that future disadvantages can be discounted. My purpose in this paper is to explore the issues of intergenerational equity raised by climate change. To do so, it is necessary to start with a recognition of the intergenerational nature of anthropogenic climate change. Greenhouse gases have a long life span and emissions at one time can exert a considerable influence on events decades, even millennia, later. To take the example of carbon dioxide: molecules of carbon dioxide can last for very different time periods, depending on whether they are located in the atmosphere or near the surface of the ocean or deep in the ocean. The average lifetime is approximately one hundred years.4 The emission of greenhouse gases thus raises questions of intergenerational, as well as international, equity. What obligations do we owe to future generations? May we (should we) apply a positive social discount rate and devote more resources to our contemporaries than to future generations? The answers to these questions make a considerable difference not simply to whether current generations should engage in mitigation or not. Suppose that we think (as very many do) that some mitigation is necessary, the social discount rate also bears on the question of how much current generations should mitigate and this remains hotly contested. To ask by how much current generations should lower emissions requires one to assess their interests with the legitimate interests of future people and so the question of whether a discount rate should be applied to future generations is crucial here. As many have emphasized, the resources to be spent on combating climate change (both the funds that should be spent on adaptation and the opportunities foregone by mitigating) could be spent on other contemporary problems—including malaria, AIDS, malnutrition, and global poverty.5 A number of different reasons have been suggested as to why current generations may legitimately favor devoting resources to contemporaries rather than to future generations. These—either individually or jointly—challenge the case for combating climate change. In this paper, I distinguish between three different kinds of reason for favoring contemporaries. I argue that none of these arguments is persuasive. My answer in each case appeals to the concept of human rights. It maintains that a human rights-centered perspective to climate change enables us to address each of these reasons. To address the question of how current generations should make decisions which bear on the interests of future people, it is essential to introduce the concept of a social discount rate.6 This concept has been discussed by economists from Alfred Marshall, A. C. Pigou, and Frank Ramsey to contemporary economists like Sir Nicholas Stern.7 It refers to the rate by which the claims of future generations to resources currently held by current generations diminishes or increases or remains constant over time. A social discount rate, thus, determines the extent to which resources should be devoted to people's interests now in preference to people's interests at a later date.8 The higher the positive social discount rate the less should be spent on the future. To explicate the concept further and relate it to the issue of climate change, it is useful to have some figures in front of us. The Stern Review has famously argued that the cost of attaining a stabilization level of 550 pm CO2e, thereby mitigating climate change, amounts to approximately one percent of global GDP per annum.9 Eric Neumayer calculates that, in practice, this would require an outlay of $350 billion per annum rising to a figure of $1000 billion by 2050.10 So the question to be examined is whether this sum is better spent on current generations or on future generations. Why might one legitimately hold that the money should be spent on current generations rather than future ones? Standard analyses of the social discount rate comprise four separate components, each of which shall be dealt with in turn. A. First, there is what economists call pure time preference. Some hold that it is appropriate to ascribe a lower weight to human interests the further they are in the future just because of the fact that they exist in the future. Thus, one reason for adopting a social discount rate is that one thinks it appropriate to reflect pure time preference. Pigou, Ramsey and, more recently, Sir Nicholas Stern have argued that pure time preference is morally illegitimate.11 Similarly, Roy Harrod famously says that ""pure time preference [is] a polite expression for rapacity and the conquest of reason by passion.""12 On his view, it is ""a human infirmity.""13 Henry Sidgwick takes a similar view, stating that ""the time at which a man exists cannot affect the value of his happiness from a universal point of view; and that the interests of posterity must concern a Utilitarian as much as those of his contemporaries.""14 Pure time preference, however, is far from being the only relevant consideration. B. Second, we need to ascertain the correct principle of intergenerational equity. Suppose that one holds that there should not be any pure time preference. One might still permissibly decide to devote resources to current people over future people for a second reason, depending on what principle of intergenerational equity one adopts. One way to see this is to set intergenerational matters to one side for a moment. Consider a theory of justice that applies solely to a current generation. It will have several component parts. First, it has to decide whether all persons have equal moral status or whether some have greater moral standing than others. (In the intergenerational context, those who subscribe to pure time discounting are rejecting the principle of equal moral standing.) Now once we have determined this first issue we then have to decide what distributive principle applies. Should it be economic equality or a Rawlsian difference principle or libertarianism or a desert theory or a sufficientarian approach or something else? Now the same question applies at the intergenerational level. Once the issue of time discounting has been addressed, we then need to identify whether relations between generations should be determined by a principle of equality or maximizing the good or whatever the market produces or something else. The key point is that one might hold that current generations should devote resources to current generations in preference to future generations because of the distributive principle one affirms. C. Risk and Uncertainty. The considerations adduced so far do not exhaust the reasons why one might devote resources to current generations over future generations. Two additional reasons to do so arise from each generation's lack of sure knowledge of future generations. First, we lack sure knowledge of the impacts of climate change. Second, we lack sure knowledge that human life will continue to exist. For example, the Stern Review on The Economic of Climate Change discounts by 0.1 percent per annum to reflect the possibility that humanity might die out for nonclimate-related reasons.15 Clearly, it matters what changes to the environment (rising sea levels and temperature increases) occur and how likely each possible scenario is. It also matters if humanity disappears because of some nonclimate-related calamity. If humanity dies out for nonclimate-related reasons, then one reason for being concerned about climate change (its impact on human life) no longer applies.16 Now if, for either reason, one is not certain that there will be malign effects on human life then, so it might be argued, there is a case for discounting the amount which one is going to spend on preventing a calamity from possibly taking place. Before proceeding further it is worth noting the distinction between ""risk,"" on the one hand, and ""uncertainty,"" on the other. Risk refers to cases where one identifies an outcome and can determine the probability that it will occur. Uncertainty, on the other hand, refers to cases where one identifies an outcome but is not able to determine the probability of its coming to pass.17 Both might give us reason for discounting, but they are importantly different. For example, if one has reliable probabilistic assessments to hand, then one can calculate the expected utility and makes one's decision on that basis. Where, though, we face uncertainty this course of action is unavailable to us. * Putting this together, then, we see that the extent to which people may devote resources to the present as opposed to the future is a function of the following four variables: (1) the legitimacy of pure time preference (may we accord less weight to their interests?); (2) the principles of intergenerational justice (what principles of justice govern the relations between people over time?); (3) the certainty of the harmful effects (will these dangerous changes happen?); and (4) the certainty of human existence (are we sure that what we are doing will result in threats to human beings?). Let us now consider one factor in the social discount rate and analyze one common argument for prioritizing current generations over future generations that focuses on this one variable. The first argument to be scrutinized makes the following claim: Argument 1: Current generations should prioritize current generations over the interests of future generations because it is permissible (and maybe even morally required) for current people to engage in pure time preference. Argument 1 defends a positive pure time discount rate. If we accept it, it follows that current generations should spend less on mitigation and adaptation than if they adopt a zero pure time discount rate. In what follows I shall reject this view and defend an alternative. Before I introduce the view to be defended, it is worth drawing attention to the possibilities. Some apply a zero pure time discount rate to all values. As was noted earlier, Pigou, Ramsey, Sidgwick, Stern, and others have argued for the correctness of this view. A second group has defended a positive pure time discount rate. What both views have in common is their assumption that one should treat all values in the same way. All values should be subjected to exactly the same (positive, negative, or zero) pure time discount rate. A third position is, however, worth considering. This view adopts what might be termed a Scope Restricted Pure Time Discount Rate (or more simply, the Scope Restricted View). This applies a zero pure time discount rate to some values but not to others. Stated more fully, the Scope Restricted View has three features. First, it posits that there is a plurality of different values. Second, it affirms what I shall term the Rights Principle. This holds that persons have human rights to the protection of fundamental human interests from the threats posed by dangerous climate change. Climate change jeopardizes various human rights including, for example: (1) the right to life (since storm surges, flooding and freak weather events, and heat stress will all lead to human deaths); (2) the right to subsistence (since the increase in temperatures, increased flooding, and rising sea levels will lead to crop failure and therefore malnutrition); (3) the right to health (since climate change will lead to increased exposure to vector-borne diseases (like malaria) and water-borne diseases (like dengue and diarrhea); (4) the right to property (since flooding, sea-level rise, and freak weather events may destroy people's privately and collectively owned property); and (5) the right not to be subject to enforced relocation (since sea-level rises will force inhabitants of coastal settlements or small island states to move).18 The Rights Principle calls then for the nonviolation, and the protection, of these vital rights—all of which are threatened by dangerous climate change.19 There are a number of different ways of grounding these rights. I here assume that they are justified on the grounds that they protect vital human interests that are sufficient to generate duties on others.20 Now the third part of the view to be defended holds that a zero pure time discount rate should be applied to the Rights Principle, but it need not be applied to other political principles or values. Human rights that are jeopardized by climate change should thus be secured (with no discrimination against those further off in time), but other more marginal interests (like being able to travel to interesting countries, or, more generally, the interest in satisfying preferences) may be subject to a positive pure time discount rate. Current generations should then act so as not to bring about a state of affairs in which people in one hundred years' time are unable to exercise their rights, but might be allowed to weight future people's interests in preference satisfaction, say, less than current people's interest in preference satisfaction. Note that my version of the Scope Restricted View is not committed to calling for (or rejecting) a positive pure time discount rate for other values such as preference satisfaction. It simply allows the possibility that that might be the case. My emphasis is more on the first part: We may not discount current and future people's vital rights if, when and because the threat to them from climate change is further off in the future.21 A. Thus far, I have described the Scope Restricted View but not defended the approach to pure time preference that it adopts. I now wish to motivate some support for the claim that the rights jeopardized by climate change should not be subject to a positive pure time discount rate and hence why Argument 1 fails. Let us consider then what reasons might support a zero pure time discount rate. The most common argument is one originally presented by William Stanley Jevons and later defended by A. C. Pigou. In The Theory of Political Economy, Jevons writes: ""To secure a maximum of benefit in life, all future events, all future pleasures or pains, should act upon us with the same force as if they were present, allowance being made for their uncertainty. The factor expressing the effect of remoteness should, in short, always be unity, so that time should have no influence.""22 Jevons's argument, then, is that the ""maximum of benefit"" requires not according greater weight to a unit of pleasure because it is nearer in time. To prefer a smaller unit of utility at t1 to a greater unit of utility at t2 would lead to a suboptimal level of utility. We find the same argument in Pigou's seminal The Economics of Welfare. It is on the basis of this argument that he concludes that pure time preference is a failure of rationality: in his words, ""our telescopic faculty is defective.""23 Clearly, this argument will not provide a defense of the Scope Restricted View outlined previously. Moreover, even if we set this aside, the limitations of this argument are fairly clear. It presupposes a maximizing consequentialism and for very familiar reasons (its indifference to the distribution of goods and its insensitivity to individual rights) I think that that position is unacceptable. Indeed, the argument exemplifies and illustrates a deep flaw in any maximizing doctrine. Consider the situation of an individual who is born in the future. The Jevons–Pigou argument would provide such a person with greater protection than they would be afforded by a positive pure time discount rate. However, note that that outcome is not animated by a commitment to the individual per se. Jevons's and Pigou's argument does aid the condition of future people but it does so only indirectly. Its direct concern is with increasing the total amount of well-being and it happens that a zero pure time discount rate furthers that goal. It illustrates well Rawls's objection that utilitarianism treats each individual merely as ""a container-person.""24 Given the problems with this argument, let us consider an alternative argument. B. A second objection to Argument 1 appeals (at a general level) to the ideal of impartiality and then (more specifically) to the logic underlying the Rights Principle. Consider impartiality first. The ideal of impartiality insists that political decisions should not reward or penalize people on the grounds of personal properties that lack any fundamental moral relevance. It is on this basis that we hold that persons should not be discriminated against because of their race or gender or socioeconomic class. These factors do not correspond to any morally relevant features of persons. In the same way, however, it seems inappropriate to discriminate against a person simply because of their location in time, for that seems equally arbitrary. It may be appropriate to favor some in some circumstances—if they are more deserving or more needy or they some possess other morally relevant property—but simply being born further into the future is not one of these properties. Put the other way round: being born earlier in time is just not the right kind of property to justify favoritism. To illustrate this point, we may consider Sidgwick's defense of a zero pure time discount rate for this exemplifies the kind of reasoning advocated by the impartiality argument. Sidgwick's argument appeals to what is of fundamental importance from a utilitarian point of view (namely, ""utility"") and deduces the appropriate pure time discount rate from that. Given that all that matters is the promotion of utility, it follows that ""the time at which a man exists cannot affect the value of his happiness from a universal point of view; and that the interests of posterity must concern a Utilitarian as much as those of his contemporaries.""25 This Impartiality Argument can similarly be applied to the reasoning underlying the Rights Principle. Consider again the fundamental tenets of the theory. The argument for the protection of core rights invokes an orthodox conception of rights (in my case Raz's ""interest theory"").26 The latter ascribes rights to agents when this protects an interest that is sufficient to impose duties on others. This, note, makes no reference to time. All that matters is the possession of fundamental interests and the reasonableness of the demands made on others, where that might include how demanding those demands are, whether it is unfairly burdening people, and so on. Time is not a morally relevant consideration. The logic of the case for rights entails, therefore, that there should be a zero pure time discount rate for the protection of rights. Put otherwise, a theory of justice animated by the dignity of persons and respect for their interests contains in it no room for ascribing lesser protection of these rights for some than for others. This argument thus defends the application of zero pure time discount rate to the protection of rights. Note, moreover, that the argument under scrutiny does not commit us to applying a zero pure time discount rate to any other values. It simply appeals to the rationale underlying rights and argues that these do not allow any pure time discounting. As such it is, of course, silent on what kind of pure time discount rate is appropriate for other values. In short, this argument justifies the Scope Restricted View defined earlier in this section (II.A).27 * It would be useful at this point to take stock and to return to the case of climate change. I have defended a zero pure time discount rate for the protection of the human rights jeopardized by climate change. This is supported by the Impartiality Argument (and an examination of the rationale underlying rights). This conclusion has considerable importance for climate change because the latter jeopardizes key rights. Given that these should receive equal weighting throughout time this strengthens the case for an aggressive program of mitigation. Let us now turn to a second type of argument for devoting resources to current people over future people. Consider the following common argument: Argument 2: Future generations will be wealthier than current generations and it is therefore more appropriate for current generations to devote resources to their contemporaries rather than to future people. It follows that it would be wrong to mitigate on behalf of future generations when they will be much better off than us.28 This is not an argument for pure time discounting. It is an argument for thinking that even if those who are currently alive weight future people's well-being as equal in standing to that of their contemporaries, they should devote more resources to their contemporaries because current generations are worse off than future generations will be.29 It makes the case for what William Nordhaus calls ""growth discounting.""30 Broken down into its constituent parts, this argument claims: It is wrong to devote resources to future generations rather than to current generations if future generations are wealthier than current generations. Future generations will be wealthier than current generations. Therefore, Other things being equal, it is wrong to devote resources to future generations rather than to current generations. One response to this would be to dispute premise (2) and to challenge whether this would be the case even if there is dangerous climate change. Alternatively, one might query the certitude with which this argument pronounces that future generations will definitely be wealthier. Can we be that sure? Such confidence certainly seems unwarranted at the moment. Isn't there a risk that a global recession might leave some future generations worse off than the current one? If so, how does that affect the argument?31 I want, however, to focus on premise (1) and to argue that (1) relies on an implausible principle of intergenerational justice. Why would it be wrong to devote resources to future generations if they are wealthier than current generations? A. Three reasons suggest themselves. First, of course, many welfare economists who subscribe to (1) will appeal to the principle of diminishing marginal utility.32 That is to say, they will start with a commitment to utilitarianism and then add that the marginal utility of each extra unit of wealth decreases the wealthier a person is. It follows from these two assumptions that, if future generations will be wealthier than current generations, then it is wrong to devote resources to future generations. Therefore, current generations can discount the resources to be devoted to future generations. However, this argument is vulnerable to an obvious objection, namely that it fails to disaggregate within generations and hence tolerates outcomes in which some lead appalling lives.33 It succeeds only if we consider each future generation as an aggregate and if we do not distinguish, for example, between the future Africans and future Americans who are members of the same generation. Thus even if a future generation at t2 is very wealthy and much wealthier than the generation alive at t1 that can hide the fact that some are very badly off at t2 (and indeed are worse off than some of the poorest at t1). Once disaggregated in this way, the case for devoting resources to the present (which in this context means not pursuing mitigation on behalf of future generations) diminishes because by doing so we will be bringing into existence a state of affairs in the future in which some, perhaps many, are needlessly unable to enjoy the fundamental rights specified by the Rights Principle. There are, however, more sophisticated arguments for (1) which avoid this problem. Consider, for example, the following two arguments: The Ability to Pay Argument: This holds that justice requires that those with the most ability to pay should bear the burden of combating social ills. It follows from this that if future generations are wealthier then they should foot the bill for combating climate change. In virtue of their wealth, they can bear the burden more easily than current generations. The Cost-Effectiveness Argument: This holds that we should distribute resources in the most cost-effective manner. If future generations are wealthier then they have a greater ability to save lives than do current generations. Therefore, they, rather than current generations, should pay because by doing so they can achieve more good.34 These arguments are subtly different. The Cost-Effectiveness Argument is concerned with the number of lives saved and says that deferring the effort to combat climate change to later generations would be desirable because by doing so we can save more lives. The Ability to Pay Argument, by contrast, is not committed to the claim that deferring the effort until later saves more lives. It claims that it is fairer to any would-be duty-bearers to postpone efforts till later.35 Its focus is on the putative duty-bearers (it is wrong to burden X if Y is wealthier); whereas the focus of the Cost-Effectiveness Argument is on the recipients of any program designed to combat climate change, and more generally secure people's rights (it is wrong for humanity to try to help group (A) now when humanity could help group (A+100) later). Both the Ability to Pay Argument and the Cost-Effectiveness Argument are better arguments than the preceding utilitarian one because, unlike it, they are not necessarily indifferent to the protection of human rights, including those rights specified by the Rights Principle. Proponents of both can be concerned with ensuring that everyone has a guaranteed decent standard of living. Both are nonetheless unconvincing. B. Consider first the Ability to Pay Principle Argument. This encounters several problems. First, as I have argued at greater length elsewhere, the problem with relying on this principle to attribute responsibilities is simply that it conflicts with a very deep conviction that polluters should generally pay for their acts of pollution.36 If, for example, I leave rubbish in the street then, ceteris paribus, I have primary responsibility to clear it up—not some other actor who happens to have more wealth than me. Similarly, if my firm releases toxic waste into a river thereby harming others, we have a strong conviction that my firm should be held accountable for this—and not another firm that is wealthier. The view that the polluter should pay is one that is deeply rooted in our moral convictions and it follows from the principle that agents should be held responsible for their ends. Suppose, though, that we accord some role to the Ability to Pay Principle, a second complication with the argument is that accepting the Ability to Pay Principle does not entail that we should allocate all of the burden associated with this role to future generations. Even if future people are, as an aggregate, wealthier than the current generation, there are, no doubt, some who are currently alive who are much wealthier than many future people will be. So an Ability to Pay Principle would require them to bear a burden in proportion to their wealth. Rather than allocate all responsibilities to future generations, it would endorse a scheme in which some wealthy current people pay and some poor future people do not. (Note, of course, that this second response cannot show that all growth discounting is impermissible. It simply establishes that the responsibility cannot be attributed entirely to future generations—but, for all that it says, it is compatible with thinking that some of it should be borne by contemporaries. As such, it is compatible with the current generation attributing some priority to [some] contemporaries.) There are, however, deeper problems with the Ability to Pay Argument. That many future people will be wealthier than many of those who are currently alive does not entail postponing the effort to combat climate change later for two further reasons. First, obviously the cost of tackling the problem may—indeed almost certainly, will—increase and might increase by more than the increase in wealth. It is a nonsequitur to affirm that since a generation at t2 is wealthier than a generation at t1, it follows that the t2 generation should address the problem. Furthermore, the economic evidence strongly suggests that the rate of growth of the cost will exceed the rate of growth of global GDP. The appeal of an Ability to Pay Principle is that by allocating the tasks to the most advantaged it both enables a task to be performed and ensures that the duty-bearers are more able to pursue their own ends and goals.

We measured discount rates among Ugandan farmers who made decisions about when to enjoy entertainment instead of working. We find that experimentally induced thoughts about poverty-related problems increase the preference to consume entertainment early and delay work. The effect is equivalent to a 27 p.p. increase in the intertemporal rate of substitution. Using monitoring tools similar to eye tracking, a novel feature for this subject pool, we show this effect is not due to a lower ability to sustain attention.",2018,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Time preference,25

10.2139/ssrn.1720983,Risk Preferences Under Extreme Poverty: A Field Experiment,,"Until now, the dominant belief concerning the relationship between poverty and risk aversion is that the poor are more risk averse. If the poor are more risk averse, then they will choose “low risk-low return” activities that trap them in poverty. However, both empirical and experimental evidence show no clear pattern such as would suggest that the poor are somehow more averse to risk than others; at times, they even seem to embrace risk, while at other times, there seems to be no difference. Focus has tended to be on extreme behaviors, as these are related to sub-optimal decisions such as have even raised questions whether an individual can be simultaneously both poor and rational. Amongst all the available empirical evidence, there is one bit of evidence of special interest - changes in behavior whenever subsistence is at risk. This paper emerges from the fact that recent experimental evidence in both psychology and economics suggests that certain decisions made under risk respond to reference points. We develop a theory within the traditional stream of rational choices, whereby the references are set by only observable variables, such as prices and family size. According to this theory, extremely poor individuals respond to the income reference that guarantees the consumption of the necessary calories so as to ensure a healthy and longer life. Being in the neighborhood of this reference can incentivize both the seeking of high risk, whenever below the reference, and an aversion to high risk, when above. An experimental exercise was conducted involving 92 individuals from households living in poverty and extreme poverty wherein they participated in a baseline risk experiment that was the one we analyzed. Inasmuch as the treatment was not randomly assigned, but instead was determined based on households’ per-capita incomes, a quasi-experimental approach was used to analyze the results. We use a regression discontinuity design, and find evidence suggesting that being presented with the opportunity of avoiding undernourishment significantly decreases a household’s risk aversion.",2010,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Risk preference,5
10.1504/ijhd.2017.087937,"Poverty, happiness, and risk preferences in rural Ethiopia",,This paper examines the relationship between risk preferences and self-reported assessments of happiness in life for a sample of peasants from 15 different sites in rural Ethiopia. The relationships were estimated using ordered probit models and the results show that happier subjects were more likely to choose risky alternatives in both real and hypothetical experimental games. The correlation between happiness and willingness to take risk remains positive even when endogeneity of happiness is accounted for using the instrumental variables' estimation technique. The empirical results seem to be consistent with the hypothesis that innate optimism and the resulting overestimation of the probabilities of favourable outcomes by the subjects is the dominant force driving the correlation between happiness and risk preferences. This implies that creating an environment where optimism can flourish may not only help improve social wellbeing but may also encourage entrepreneurial endeavours.,2017,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Risk preference,2
10.1111/1468-246x.00061,The World Bank Approach to Pension Reform,,"This paper highlights the World Bank’s thinking and worldwide involvement in pension reform. Both are driven by the Bank’s mandate to help countries develop economically and to reduce poverty. The Bank has four key concerns in working with clients on pension policy: (1) short‐term financing and long‐term financial viability; (2) effects on economic growth; (3) adequacy and other distributive issues; and (4) political risk and sustainability. In response to these concerns and after review of the three main reform options for unfunded systems ‐ mere PAYG reform, a rapid and complete shift to a mandatory funded system, and a gradual shift to a multipillar scheme ‐ the Bank clearly favours the multipillar approach but in a pragmatic and country‐specific manner. When helping to implement a pension reform the Bank fully takes account of country preferences and circumstances, bases its support on sound reform criteria, links the client assistance with knowledge management, provides training and other measures to enhance the reform capacity of a country, and seeks cooperation with other international institutions. In addition, the Bank has a comprehensive research agenda to improve the working of multipillar schemes, and the investigations include issues of coverage, administrative costs and annuities.",2000,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Risk preference,181
10.1111/j.1467-9353.2007.00356.x,"Session Discussion: Dynamic Risk Preferences, Poverty Traps, and Thresholds",,"These papers constitute a renewed search for an alternative to what Just and Michelson describe as the classic utility function-a concave function of current wealth plus contemporaneous income. The motivation for this search can be viewed as a response to Matthew Rabin's demonstration that uniform concavity has incredible implications for behavior (e.g., Rabin and Thaler). The remedy Just and Michelson seek is (explicitly or implicitly) an indirect utility function in first-period income, albeit with both concave and convex segments, such that the decision-maker can be risk-averse or risk-loving, depending on the range of outcomes for the decision in question. A unifying theme of the session is that nonconvexities in transaction costs and asset returns, especially capital-stock thresholds, induce the appearance of risk preferences without the contrivance of exogenous risk preferences in first-period income. Buschena and Zilberman assume that the prototypical decision maker has different concave utility functions for different status levels. Assuming that the probability distribution of being in various status groups is a function of income in the current period, one can readily derive indirect utility functions of current-period income. For the two-status case, this results in a Friedman-Savage (FS) shaped indirect utility function. This helps underscore the presumption of both concave and convex segments, albeit by assuming the existence of classic utility functions in the first place. The intuition of the convex section in the middle of the FS function is clear enough; it stems from the prospect of a discontinuous jump to the high-status utility function. But one wonders why the function should be concave at very low incomes. Indeed, Lybbert and Barrett discuss the illustrative case of two thresholds-one at subsistence income and a Micawber threshold",2007,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Risk preference,1
10.1017/s0047279406009834,"Sour Grapes: Relative Deprivation, Adaptive Preferences and the Measurement of Poverty",,"One frequently used direct measure of deprivation and poverty is the objective relative deprivation index ( O-RDindex ), developed by Mack and Lansley (1985). One assumption underlying the O-RDindex is that respondents can distinguish between what that they cannot afford and what they do not want. This assumption contradicts the subjective usage of the concept relative deprivation (S-RD), which suggests a connection between economic circumstances, choice of reference group and consumption preferences. The present analysis supports the S-RD assumptions. People with limited access to economic resources are more likely to say they ‘do not want’ various consumable items. The results indicate a subjective bias that leads to underestimation of the incidence of O-RD among those suffering from the greatest economic hardship. However, it is also concluded that asking people to differentiate between choice and economic constraint improves our measurement of O-RD and decreases the risk that relatively well-off individuals will score high on the O-RDindex due to peculiar prioritising of consumption. Yet it is still the case that the social mechanisms related to S-RD most probably lead to underestimation of O-RD.",2006,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Risk preference,100

Mechanisms by which poverty affects development, however, remain unclear. To explore one potential mechanism of poverty's impact on social-emotional and cognitive development, an experimental examination of a rodent model of scarcity-adversity was conducted and compared to results from a longitudinal study of human infants and families followed from birth (N = 1,292) who faced high levels of poverty-related scarcity-adversity. Cross-species results supported the hypothesis that altered caregiving is one pathway by which poverty adversely impacts development. Rodent mothers assigned to the scarcity-adversity condition exhibited decreased sensitive parenting and increased negative parenting relative to mothers assigned to the control condition. Furthermore, scarcity-adversity reared pups exhibited decreased developmental competence as indicated by disrupted nipple attachment, distress vocalization when in physical contact with an anesthetized mother, and reduced preference for maternal odor with corresponding changes in brain activation. Human results indicated that scarcity-adversity was inversely correlated with sensitive parenting and positively correlated with negative parenting, and that parenting fully mediated the association of poverty-related risk with infant indicators of developmental competence. Findings are discussed from the perspective of the usefulness of bidirectional-translational research to inform interventions for at-risk families.",2018,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Risk preference,57
10.1080/00324720903497081,Preferences for the sex-composition of children in Europe: A multilevel examination of its effect on progression to a third child,,"Abstract Comparative research on the preferred sex of children in Western societies has generally focused on women only and ignored the role of gender equity and the need for children's economic support in old age. A multilevel analysis extends existing research by examining, for both men and women and across 24 European countries, the effect of the preferred sex-composition of offspring on whether parents have or intend to have a third child. Using the European Social Survey (2004/5), a multilevel (random coefficient) ordered logit regression of that intention (N=3,323) and a binary logistic multilevel model of the transition to a third child (N=6,502) demonstrate the presence of a mixed-sex preference. In countries with a high risk of poverty in old age, a preference for sons is found, particularly for men. In societies where there is lower gender equity, both men and women have a significant preference for boys. Keywords: fertilitychildrenparentsgendersex-compositionequalityequityEurope Notes 1.

10.2489/jswc.66.2.87,Risk preferences as determinants of soil conservation decisions in Ethiopia,,"Soil degradation is one of the most serious environmental problems in the highlands of Ethiopia. The prevalence of traditional agricultural land use and the absence of appropriate resource management often result in the degradation of natural soil fertility. This has important implications for soil productivity, household food security, and poverty. Given the extreme vulnerability of farmers in this area, we hypothesized that farmers9 risk preferences might affect the sustainability of resource use. This study presents experimental results on the willingness of farmers to take risks and relates the subjective risk preferences to actual soil conservation decisions. The study looked at a random sample of 143 households with 597 farming plots. We found that a high degree of risk aversion significantly decreases the probability of adopting soil conservation. This implies that reducing farmers9 risk exposure could promote soil conservation practices and thus more sustainable natural resource management. This might be achieved by improving tenure security, promoting access to extension services and education, and developing income-generating off-farm activities.",2011,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Risk preference,55

The analyses are related to theoretical assumptions about adaptation of preferences, risk exposure, and welfare-state attitudes. It is shown that adaptation of preference increases the ""evaluation gap"" between the two measures. Risk exposure generally does not lead to a more generous evaluation of the poverty line or to a narrower evaluation gap. Positive sentiments toward redistribution are connected with a generous assessment of the poverty line and a small evaluation gap. Those who believe that welfare benefits are misused have a restrictive view of both the poverty line and the minimum income they can accept for themselves.",2004,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Risk preference,27

This paper argues and attributes the low level of technology adoption and impact to the discrepancy between the farmers' needs and the attributes of technologies generated. The empirical evidences have been generated based on the analyses of coffee farmers' variety attribute preferences, taking coffee seedlings as production technologies. Attribute preferences of smallholder farmers are governed by their contextual household characteristics, institutional, and socioeconomic factors. According to the results, risk vulnerable farmers prefer seeds adaptable to their local conditions and varieties with stable yield attribute. On the contrary, farmers in more accessible areas and/or those who are less concerned in securing subsistence income levels opt for income maximizing attributes, namely, yield and marketability. The study results have also shown the mechanisms of how farmers' attribute preferences change with development‐oriented interventions. The paper demonstrates why and how policy‐makers should formulate context specific technology development and agricultural extension strategies.",2007,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Risk preference,56

In 2005, HIV infection prevalence in the age group 15-24 years was 16.9% in women and 4.4% in men (1). The high HIV prevalence in this country is a result of a number of factors which include the following: poverty, violence against women, cultural limitations that promote intergenerational sex, non-condom use and preference for “dry sex,” political factors and challenges that possibly prevented an aggressive response against HIV, recreational drug use, and biological factors such as high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STI). This essay will present and discuss the prevalence of HIV among young women in South Africa and the reasons for such a high prevalence in the country. I will also give an overview of the intervention programs that are currently under way with an aim to reduce the vulnerability of young women in South Africa.

10.1111/j.1465-7295.2009.00198.x,RISK‐TAKING BEHAVIOR IN THE PRESENCE OF NONCONVEX ASSET DYNAMICS,,"The growing literature on poverty traps emphasizes the links between multiple equilibria and risk avoidance. However, multiple equilibria may also foster risk-taking behavior by some poor people. We illustrate this idea with a simple analytical model in which people with different wealth and ability endowments make investment and risky activity choices in the presence of known nonconvex asset dynamics. This model underscores a crucial distinction between familiar static concepts of risk aversion and forward-looking dynamic risk responses to nonconvex asset dynamics. Even when unobservable preferences exhibit decreasing absolute risk aversion, observed behavior may suggest that risk aversion actually increases with wealth near perceived dynamic asset thresholds. Although high ability individuals are not immune from poverty traps, they can leverage their capital endowments more effectively than lower ability types and are therefore less likely to take seemingly excessive risks. In general, linkages between behavioral responses and wealth dynamics often seem to run in both directions. Both theoretical and empirical poverty trap research could benefit from making this two-way linkage more explicit.",2010,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Risk preference,36

My goal is to demonstrate that certain socio-economic characteristics matter universally for attitude formation, but that their impact varies according to specific welfare state institutions. Analysing poverty risks and the structural position of minimum income protection schemes in the welfare state, I hypothesize that attitudes may be more polarized in generous welfare states than in less generous states. Additionally, I assume that labour market performance may have an influence on attitudes, leading to more sympathetic positions towards state responsibility in times of high unemployment. Using data from Eurobarometer 56.1 (2001) and performing country-wise regressions, I demonstrate that individual socio-economic traits impact on attitudes depending on national contexts. Combining preferences and degrees of polarization shows that attitudes might be formed in the interplay between welfare state and labour market.",2009,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Risk preference,54
10.1111/j.1728-4465.1999..x,"Explanations of Unmet Need for Contraception in Chitwan, Nepal",,"This article explores reasons why women's fertility preferences and their contraceptive behaviors often appear to be contradictory. Ninety-eight separate interviews with women and their husbands conducted in rural Chitwan District, Nepal, over a 12-month period in 1993-94 revealed that people continually and self-consciously weigh the perceived benefits and risks of practicing family planning relative to their situations. Temporary and, especially, hormonal methods are perceived to carry unacceptable health risks. Contraceptive technologies are evaluated in relation to competing priorities and interests. Household poverty heightened the perceived risk of family planning use; poor people fear they can ill afford negative effects to their health that might result. People assess their health status and physical workload, factors that they believe condition their ability to use family planning methods without experiencing damaging health effects. Strategies employed to lower contraceptive risk include altering the method of choice, manipulating relationships with spouses, timing the adoption of contraceptives, managing the context of service provision, and acting in light of the experiences of others. Qualitative findings from the fieldwork are complemented by analysis of data from a standardized fertility survey.",1999,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Risk preference,59
10.1111/risa.12976,Variability in Cross‐Domain Risk Perception among Smallholder Farmers in Mali by Gender and Other Demographic and Attitudinal Characteristics,,"Previous research has shown that men and women, on average, have different risk attitudes and may therefore see different value propositions in response to new opportunities. We use data from smallholder farm households in Mali to test whether risk perceptions differ by gender and across domains. We model this potential association across six risks (work injury, extreme weather, community relationships, debt, lack of buyers, and conflict) while controlling for demographic and attitudinal characteristics. Factor analysis highlights extreme weather and conflict as eliciting the most distinct patterns of participant response. Regression analysis for Mali as a whole reveals an association between gender and risk perception, with women expressing more concern except in the extreme weather domain; however, the association with gender is largely absent when models control for geographic region. We also find lower risk perception associated with an individualistic and/or fatalistic worldview, a risk-tolerant outlook, and optimism about the future, while education, better health, a social orientation, self-efficacy, and access to information are generally associated with more frequent worry-with some inconsistency. Income, wealth, and time poverty exhibit complex associations with perception of risk. Understanding whether and how men's and women's risk preferences differ, and identifying other dominant predictors such as geographic region and worldview, could help development organizations to shape risk mitigation interventions to increase the likelihood of adoption, and to avoid inadvertently making certain subpopulations worse off by increasing the potential for negative outcomes.",2018,Openalex,Preferences,Poverty and Risk preference,48
