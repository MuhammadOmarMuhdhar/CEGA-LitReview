### [Psychology and Economics of Poverty Literature Review Dashboard](https://psychology-literature-dashboard.streamlit.app)

Research on the psychological consequences of poverty has emerged from diverse academic disciplines, each offering distinct perspectives and methodologies. However, this research has often developed in isolation, leading to fragmented insights and limited interdisciplinary dialogue. This lack of integration makes it challenging to develop a comprehensive understanding of poverty and its multifaceted effects.

To address this issue, we have developed an interactive literature review tool that enables researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and others interested to explore, analyze, and synthesize knowledge from this growing body of research.

### Key Features of Our Tool

- **Research Exploration**: An interactive platform that allows users to navigate research findings in an intuitive manner.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizations that help users identify trends, patterns, and gaps in the literature.
- **Continuous Updates**: Designed to evolve, incorporating new studies and findings as they emerge.

### Our Mission

We aim to enhance the understanding of the psychological impacts of poverty and, when available, subsequent downstream impacts on behaviors in the real world. We seek to support evidence-based decision-making and provide a robust foundation for researchers and practitioners working to design effective interventions.

This project is being developed by the [Psychology and Economics of Poverty Initiative (PEP)](https://cega.berkeley.edu/collection/psychology-and-economics-of-poverty/) at the **Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA)** at Berkeley.
